Right now, there are two tools that are   leading the market when it comes to   building with AI. We've got Cloud Code   and Google Anti-gravity. And for the   past few months, there's been a debate   on which one of these tools is actually   the best. So, if you're trying to figure   out which AI tool to learn and use right   now, this video is going to save you a   ton of time.

 After hundreds of hours   testing both of these tools, the truth   is that each one is better for different   tasks. And even though the answer isn't   super obvious, I still think there's one   tool that you should learn over the   other. So, in this video, we'll go into   their key differences and I'll test them   in front of you guys live with different   workflows so you can see where they   shine and where they fall short.

 Then,   I'll give you guys my thoughts on which   one is the best overall. So, by the end   of this video, you'll have a clear   picture on which tool that you should   learn and use this year. So, let's get   into it. All right, so before we get   into the actual tests, you need to   understand what these tools are and how   they're actually different.

 Both Claude   Code and Anti-gravity are a coding   platforms. They can take a large   mission, break it into a plan, spin up   sub aents to work in parallel. They can   manage your files in your folders, run   terminal commands, and execute across   your entire codebase. Claude Code is   powered by Anthropics Claude models.   Anti-gravity defaults to Google's Gemini   models.

 You can switch out the model for   both of these different tools, but   sometimes it just takes a little bit of   extra configuration, but the power   ceiling on both of these tools is   extremely high. And because of this,   both tools are free to use. You're not   paying for clogged code or you're not   paying for anti-gravity. What you end up   paying for is the model usage, the   actual AI behind the scenes that's doing   the thinking.

 You're paying for the   tokens. So the difference isn't   capability, it's where those   capabilities live and how you access   them. Cloud code is terminal first. It's   a CLI tool that plugs into whatever   environment that you're already working   in. So you can keep your editor, your   key bindings, your extensions, all of it   stays the same.

 The agentic power, the   sub aents, parallel execution, the   orchestration, it's all there, but it's   surfaced through your terminal and   configured by you. You build the   workflow on top of the tool. Now,   anti-gravity is its own standalone IDE.   Some think it's a fork of VS Code, so   your extensions and shortcuts can carry   over, but you are opening a different   application entirely.

 It's got a manager   view where you can see multiple agents   working in parallel across different   workspaces and a built-in browser agent   that can navigate real web pages. The   simplest way to think about it, Cloud   Code gives you the primitives and lets   you work the way you already work.   Anti-gravity packages the whole agentic   workflow thing into a purpose-built   environment that you kind of move into.

  All right, so let's talk about what it   actually feels like to use them.   Starting with getting set up. So, Cloud   Code gives you multiple entry points.   The terminal CLI is the original and   most powerful mode. You install it with   npm and you type Claude in any terminal   and Cloud Code pops up.

 There's also a   VS Code extension with inline diffs,   plan review, file visibility, app   mentions, and all that can be right   inside your editor. Claude also gives us   a desktop app if you don't want to use   the VS Code version at all. And it's a   lot more, I'd say, userfriendly and a   web version that you can run straight   from your browser with no install.

 So,   in pretty much every single video on my   channel, you might have seen with me   using Cloud Code, I've been using it   inside of VS Code, either through the   extension or just running it in my VS   Code terminal. Now, I do that because I   like being able to see all of my files   on that lefth hand side while I'm   working with Claude Code rather than   just staring at a terminal window.

 One   thing worth noting though is that the   terminal CLI is technically the most   feature mode. The VS Code extension   covers pretty much everything, but there   are a few advanced features that are CLI   only. So, for most people getting   started, the extension is definitely   more than enough.

 Now, anti-gravity has   only one front door. You download the   app and you have to run it through   there. There is a CLI command to launch   it from your terminal, but that   basically just opens up the anti-gravity   IDE. So, there's no run anti-gravity   inside of VS Code option. So, now let's   actually get into what matters the most,   which is the quality of what the tools   produce.

 The model you use inside the   tool matters so much. If you're running   Cloud Code with Haiku, it's going to be   a completely different experience than   running Claude Code with Opus. Running   anti-gravity with Gemini Flash is not   going to be the same as running   anti-gravity with Gemini Pro. The   harness shapes how the model works, but   the model determines the ceiling.

 So,   when we talk about output quality, a lot   of it comes down to which model you're   running under the hood. Now, Cloud   Code's biggest strength is how it thinks   before it acts. It has a dedicated   planning mode, which anti-gravity does   as well. But in this planning mode, it   maps out multifile work before touching   anything.

 It'll be readon, no code   changes, just strategy and asking   clarification questions. You can control   how deep it reasons all the way up to   what Enthropic calls their ultraink for   really complex problems. Like I said,   anti-gravity also has a plan mode, but I   think that Cloud Code just does it   better.

 You'll see exactly what I mean   when we jump into all of the live tests   later. Both tools let you also set   project level rules, conventions, and   custom instructions that persist across   sessions. Both support plugins, custom   commands, and integrations with external   tools. The extensibility is there on   both sides, but Claude Code feels   extremely hackable to me because I just   feel like I have so much more control   over how I want this individual project   to behave.

 Where Cloud Code also stands   out is how well it understands your   existing project and file structure. It   reads everything. It picks up on your   patterns and naming conventions and it   builds on top of what you've already got   there. So generated code fits your   codebase rather than just feeling kind   of bolted on.

 Anti-gravity's major   strength is building full apps and   frontends from scratch. In an   independent 21-day test across 12 real   projects, 94% of the code it generated   was clean, passing limiting with no   errors or style issues. It completed   about 73% of tasks without any human   intervention and delivered a 60 to 70%   reduction in development time.

 Now, when   I've used anti-gravity, I've mainly used   it for designing things, UI, UX   elements, websites, web apps, things   like that. I just think that it does a   much better job compared to cloud code   and opus for like having actual taste   and making things just look and feel   more real. But there is a trade-off   because on longer projects, anti-gravity   can start to drift away from the rules   that you set at the beginning.

 Now, this   is a documented pattern. Google's own   developer forums have a thread about   this. It might build something perfectly   to spec on day one and then gradually   start ignoring your original guidelines   by day three. Now, to be fair, this is   generally true for any coding agent with   any coding model, but I did want to call   this out here.

 Now, let's look at some   benchmarks. The SWE bench verified is   the industry standard test for AI coding   tools. It takes real GitHub issues from   real open source projects and it   measures how many get fully resolved by   the AI model. Claude Opus 4.6 inside of   Cloud Code scored an 80.9%. Gemini 3 Pro   inside of anti-gravity came in at around   76.2%.

 Both of these scores involve the   full harness, which is the tool plus the   model together. But Google hasn't   published the exact testing methodology   the way Anthropic has, so it's not a   perfect apples to apples comparison, but   at the top tier model level, these tools   are remarkably close on paper. Now, real   world results.

 Anthropic's engineering   team reported that Cloud Code gave them   a 50% productivity gain and 67% more   pull requests merged per engineer per   day. On the anti-gravity side, the   independent 21-day test showed 60 to 70%   faster development. Both numbers are   extremely impressive. Neither is a   controlled scientific study, but   directionally they tell you both tools   are making developers significantly   faster.

 But now, let's talk about speed   and reliability. Remember, what you're   paying for when you're using these tools   is not the tool, you're paying for the   model. And these models will burn   through kind of your usage or your   limits faster than you may expect,   especially if you're not being careful.   Cloud code recently in March of 26 had a   caching bug that inflated token costs by   maybe 10 to 20x.

 For max plan users,   they were draining their entire session   in under two hours. Enthropic has   acknowledged this and seems to be   constantly working on token   optimization, which is obviously going   to be an ongoing kind of project.   Anti-gravity has its own issues as well.   Google's quota system has been all over   the place with pro users getting locked   out for a full week after hitting limits   and a credit based pricing system that   still doesn't clearly explain what a   credit actually buys you.

 So, in   general, learning how to manage your   context and tokens is one of the most   important skills that you can be   building right now because it translates   to whatever coding agent you end up   using. I made a full video on 18 token   management hacks that I found while   experimenting with these tools, and I   will link that one right up here.

 Now,   in terms of task speed, an independent   test found that Cloud Code completed a   representative task in about 4 minutes   versus anti-gravity's 8 minutes, which I   thought was interesting because in my   testing, anti-gravity's always felt   faster. And you guys will see that later   in the video when we do these real   tests.

 Now, the real difference in   reliability right now is about maturity.   Cloud Code is production released with   multiple updates shipping per week.   Anti-gravity is still in public preview   as of today, April 2026, but it is   improving very fast. It still does   though carry the instability that comes   with the stage of public preview.

 Some   people are reporting login issues.   There's occasional bugs on Windows and   agents are getting stuck in loops. Now,   context loss is real for both of these   tools. Even with Claude Code's 1 million   context window with Opus, there can be   issues when you're loading real code   bases, running lots of tool calls, and   going back and forth for 40 plus   prompts.

 At that point, the AI starts to   just lose track of earlier instructions.   Anti-gravity's own troubleshooting docs   recommends starting a new chat once the   agent takes more than 10 seconds to   respond. Claude Code has a compact   command that compresses your   conversation history, but the best   practice for both of these tools is the   same.

 Keep your sessions focused, one   task per session. Start fresh often.   Now, one more thing that I did want to   mention is the pace of development is   just crazy. Cloud Code has been shipping   at an insane rate. In quarter 1 of 2026   alone, they dropped six major platform   level features with multiple releases   per week.

 And at one point, there was   three different releases in the span of   5 days. Anti-gravity has also been   improving and updating, but the cadence   is notably different. From launch in   November through March of 2026, so you   know, about four or five months, the   version numbers went from 1.11 to 1.21   21 with most updates being a handful of   improvements and minor bug fixes and   optimizations.

 So, both are actively   being developed, but cloud code is   moving significantly faster. And when   you're choosing a tool to invest your   time in, I think that that matters a   lot. All right, so let's talk about   integrations because a coding tool is   truly only as useful as what it can   actually connect to. Both of these   coding tools support MCP, model context   protocol, the open standard that lets AI   tools plug into external services.

  GitHub, databases, superbase, playright,   firecrawl, design tools, monitoring   platforms. Over 1500 MCP servers are out   there at this point and that number is   growing. The difference is setup. Cloud   Code's MCP integration is CLI driven.   You add servers with a single command or   by prompting Cloud Code to do so or by   editing a JSON config file scoped   globally per project or maybe per user.

  Whereas anti-gravity has more of a   visual MCP panel built into it where you   can kind of like browse through a   marketplace and click to install MCPs   and things like that. that it's a little   bit more beginner friendly to start   with, but for advanced setups, you're   still going to need to end up editing   that config file, which also is not very   difficult at all.

 Because with both of   these tools, you could say, "Hey, here's   the MCP server URL that I want to   download. Help me figure out how I   actually do this." Both tools also have   direct terminal access, meaning they can   use any other CLIs, which is huge. Git,   MPM, Docker, Playright, Google   Workspace.

 If it has a CLI and it runs   in a terminal, then either tool can   actually use it. You can even run Claude   code CLI inside anti-gravity's terminal   if you want both tools in one   environment. All right, so now let's   talk about pricing. First, let me   reframe real quick how you think about   this. Because even if you're paying for   Claude's most expensive plan right now,   $200 a month, for the level of output   that you can get from either of these   tools, you would never be able to hire a   human to do that same amount of work for   that same price. Meaning, what human   would give you all of this productivity   and output for only 200 bucks a month?   So, no matter which tool you choose or   how much money you're investing into   these subscriptions, you're getting an   insane amount of leverage for the money.   It's a steal right now. Now, Cloud Code   requires a paid Claude pan. So, if you   start with Claude Code's lowest   subscription, that is Pro, and that's   $20 a month, which gives you access to   the platform. You can also use your API   key, but that might end up being more   expensive than just a subscription. But   most heavy users end up on the max,   which is either 100 bucks a month for   five times more usage than Pro, or 200   bucks a month for 20 times more usage   than Pro. When you're actively building,   you burn through the pro limit pretty   quickly. You could always just start on   pro and then you could upgrade later if

  you need to and you can pay for extra   usage beyond your plan on standard IPI   rates or of course you could plug in   some sort of open source model or a much   cheaper model if you wanted to do so but   you're going to lose a lot of the value   of Opus of course because that's like   one of the smartest models right now.

  Anti-gravity is tied to the Google's AI   subscription plans. So there is a free   tier with basic access and weekly rate   limits. Everyone gets Gemini 3 Pro   unlimited code completions and all   features regardless of the tier. But the   free limit runs out fast if you're doing   real work.

 Google AI Pro is 20 bucks a   month with higher rate limits that   refresh every 5 hours, plus 2 terabytes   of Google storage and $10 in monthly   Google Cloud credits. Google AI Ultra is   250 bucks a month and it gives you the   highest rate limits. Now, one important   note, some users report that even on   Pro, the rate limits for premium models   like Cloud Opus inside of anti-gravity   are very restrictive, like getting   locked out after a single session.

 So,   if you're planning to use non-Gemini   models heavily inside of anti-gravity,   just keep that in mind. But the bottom   line here on cost is that if you're just   getting started and you want to   experiment, anti-gravity's free tier   lets you try it out for zero bucks. So   if you want reliable daily production   level use, you're going to probably want   to pay for something whether that's   cloud code on max, which gives you the   most consistent experience right now.

 At   the highest tiers, 200 bucks for cloud   code, 250 bucks for anti-gravity.   They're in a similar range. Now, you   might think of that as a not very cheap   subscription, but with heavy usage,   you're still getting way more output   than you would than hiring a developer   and so much cheaper.

 All right, so we've   covered all of the key differences.   Let's do a sideby-side build comparison.   Now, real quick before we get into the   testing, I'm going to put all of this   information that we've talked about   today, including kind of the results and   the tests, into a free resource guide,   which you can access for completely free   in my free school community.

 The link   for that is down in the description. But   anyways, let's get into the live builds.   All right, so we have a couple tests to   run here. And the way I'm going to do   this is I have anti-gravity pulled up on   the left, and I have Cloud Code pulled   up right here on the right. So, we're   going to do three different tests.

 The   first one is going to be me shooting off   just basically this one shot prompt, not   in plan mode. So, I'm going to change   this to fast mode and make sure this is   on bypass permissions. And the idea is I   want to see how well each of these two   agent coding platforms work for us just   giving them a pretty vague request and   we'll see what happens.

 The second one   is going to be we do something similar   but we use plan mode to see how their   planning works. And then the third one   is going to be sort of like a website   design and we're kind of purely basing   it off of design output at that point as   well as like kind of the planning and   everything.

 So, let's just go ahead and   shoot off both of these. Like I said,   this one's running over here in   anti-gravity with Gemini 3.1 Pro. And   this one's running over here in Cloud   Code with Opus 4.6. So, what I said was   to build a full stack habit tracker app   with a dashboard that shows streaks, a   calendar heat map, and the ability to   add, edit, and delete habits.

 I said to   not use the superpower skill because   that's something I have in Claude Code   that makes its outputs much better. And   if you want to watch that video that I   made about the superpower skill, I will   link it right up here. But I told it not   to use that because I want this to be as   fair as possible.

 So, I'm going to let   these two things run and I'll let you   guys know when we have our outputs. All   right, as far as a speed component, you   can see here that anti-gravity has   finished and cloud code is still   running. So, before we click into it,   let's actually see what they did from a   file perspective.

 So, if I open up the   files over here for both of these, you   can see that cloud code made a folder   called superpowers with content and   state. Then, we have docs with plans and   specs. And then we have a habit tracker   with all of the actual folders for   what's going on inside the actual site.   And over here we can see that   anti-gravity did something not very   similar.

 We have node modules with a ton   of folders in here. And all of these,   I'm sure, are very populated with more   folders and more files. We can see we've   got a public looks like these are   images. And then we've got the SRC with   some more assets and components inside.   You may have looked at what I just   showed you with the folders and been   like, that is completely foreign   language.

 And to me, I don't really know   what's going on there either, right? But   the reason I wanted to show you that is   because the harnesses, the models,   they're just designed to, yes, achieve   the end goal we're looking for, but   they're doing it in a different way.   With that out of the way, let's open up   anti-gravity's version first.

 Okay, so   here's anti-gravity. There's nothing   here. Let me just go ahead and say the   local host is open, but I can't see   anything. The page is just completely   blank white. So, we'll shoot that off.   And while it's working on that, let me   open up Cloud Code, and we'll go to this   version right here on the local host.

  Okay, cool. We've got a habit tracker.   We've got a calendar. We have um our   streaks, stuff like this up here. Total   check-ins. We got today's date. I can   add a habit. So, let's just say we do a   walk. And I can add the day. I could   edit it. I could change the color. It   looks like Okay, that's pretty nice.

  Nice. I could delete it and we can   change the color over here as well if I   wanted to do a a green habit for YouTube   and you can change the day. So here's   you can see giving us our streak and   everything. So for a V1 with no planning   that's pretty solid. It's what we asked   for.

 It looks pretty vibe coded but   that's all right. Let's go back into   anti-gravity. See what happened here. So   apparently it fixed those changes. Let's   reopen the app now. Wow. Okay. So this   is anti-gravities. From a design   perspective I already like this one   better. We have our active habits. We   have we completed today our daily score.

  New habit we can say. Yep. We went on a   I was about to say run, but I typed a   read. So, we read I read money models   for 10 minutes. We'll go ahead and   create the habits. We can see it right   there. And that's where we're able to   check it off per day. So, this is a bit   of a different way that it actually   functions, but still delete things and   stuff like that.

 So, both of these are   doing what we asked, but they're doing   it in different ways. All right, test   number two. We are doing basically the   exact same thing, right? I'm going to   shoot this off in plan mode on both   sides. And this time I'm saying, I need   you to do research on AI trends in the   small and medium-sized business market.

  And I need you to create a PDF report   that should be no more than three pages   that gives me a holistic breakdown. So   they're going to take different   approaches here in order to create an   implementation plan and build this out   for us. They might ask us some   questions. They might not. And we're   going to basically compare.

 We didn't   tell them anything about our tech stack,   anything. We didn't even tell them like   who was this report for. So let's see   which one is able to ask us the better   questions and give us the better output.   All right. From a speed perspective,   this time we got our plan first with   cloud code. So let's see what we got.

  Threepage report. Generate an HTML file   styled for PDF outputs. We'll have an   exact summary, adoption, landscape. We   will have use cases and business impact.   We'll have challenges, workforce impact,   and outlook. And here is basically the   plan to turn this into a PDF. So the   point of this is just to see how well   they plan.

 So I'm just going to go ahead   and say yes, auto accept. Now over here   on the anti-gravity side, it says, "I   have completed the research on AI trends   in the small and medium-sized business   market and converted them into a concise   readable PDF report." So I actually was   wrong on the whole speed thing. It looks   like that anti-gravity actually came   back and already finished this.

 So in   the files over here, you can see that it   actually did already create a PDF. So   let me pull that up real quick. All   right. So here is what the result from   anti-gravity looks like. It's not really   styled at all, but it does have stuff   like the AI trends in the market for   2026, executive summary, key adoption   trends from standalone tools to embedded   systems, datadriven decision-m,   strategic implementation over trial and   error, ROI, and business impact.

 So,   we've got some other tools and stuff.   Now, what's interesting is it didn't   site any of its sources. I didn't tell   it to, but that's something that I   probably wish that it would have done.   So, it didn't site sources. We have to   just trust that all of this stuff is   credible. And it also gave us some   strategic implementation advice.

 So, I   what I don't like is that it didn't   really ask us questions about what we   were looking for specifically and it   just basically gave us an output. Now,   we obviously could go back and forth   with it and have it help us out with,   you know, researching more things in   depth or giving it some more   information, but um that is something   that I did notice.

 Now, over here on the   Clawed Code side, we're not using the   brainstorm skills, so it doesn't plan as   good. And I I do think though, I wish   that this side would have also asked   like, "Hey, how do you want this to be   created? What audience are you trying to   give this to?" Those types of questions   are really helpful.

 All right, so Cloud   Code just came back. It said that it's   done. You can see that it is right here   in our files. So, let me go ahead and   open this up from my folder. Boom. Here   is the Clawed Code report. You can   already tell it's stylized a little bit   better. It's got better headers and some   colors. It's got some tables.

 It did say   that the stats might be messed up as you   can see right here. One thing to note,   the stat highlight boxes on page one and   two have a minor layout issue. Blah blah   blah. But I would say from a planning   and execution perspective here, I would   definitely give this test to Claude Code   as the winner. Oh, no. It did.

 It did   give sources down here. ICIC report,   business.com, uh, LinkedIn economic   graph. So it did site the sources which   I also think is much better than   anti-gravity's report. Okay. So before   we shoot off this next one or actually   I'll just go ahead and shoot it off and   then what I want to talk about the way   that you get good outputs from these   tools is by understanding how they work   and using them better.

 So ultimately if   you learn cloud code really well I'm   pretty confident you could hop over to   anti-gravity and be able to use it   pretty well because you understand a lot   of the things about how agents work   together and planning and specific   outputs blah blah blah. So this last one   what I wanted to do is I wanted to do   another one where we're not planning and   we're not steering it as much.

 We're   seeing how capable are these coding   assistants with the right models in   order to actually get what we want.   Here, what I asked us to do is to design   a landing page for a premium AI   automation course targeted at agency   owners. Include a hero section, social   proof, a pricing table, and a CTA. Do   not use the brainstorm skill or   front-end design skill because that's   something that I gave Claude code that   basically helps it design UIUX.

 And do   not ask me any questions. Just give me   an output. Now, I am suspecting here   that anti-gravity is going to come back   with a better looking page. You could   already sort of see that in the habit   tracker app. But typically whenever I've   tested these two tools out, the way that   I felt is like cloud code is better for   building automations and skills and and   products, but anti-gravity has been   better with like the web app design and   the websites and things like that.

 So,   I'm going to let this run and I'll show   you guys when we have our two final   outputs. Okay, once again, anti-gravity   from a speed perspective is already   done. I'm not going to show you guys the   result yet. Let's wait to see when cloud   code finishes up. All right, there we   go. These are both done.

 So, let's   actually pull up cloud codes first.   Although the issue is actually this is   the same local host as the habit   tracker. So it basically just pulled   this up. So what I have to do real quick   is tell it to overwrite the habit   tracker with this new site. That local   host is still showing us the habit   tracker.

 Can you please update it to   show the new website that you just   built? Okay, so looks like it should   have fixed that issue. Let's open up   Claude Code site. Here we go. We've got   agency AI mastery. Stop trading time for   money. Automate your agency. Join cohort   7. You can see we got some statistics   here.

 We have some brands that might   trust us. 8 weeks zero fluff pure   implementation. We've got a bit of a   curriculum here with some background   elements when you highlight these boxes.   Don't take our word for it. We've got   our testimonials down here and some   stats float in built by someone who's   been in your shoes. We've got a pricing.

  Okay, so this doesn't look awful, right?   For one prompt, it's not bad. You can   definitely tell it was vibe coded, but   it's not horrible. Let's go ahead and   look at anti-gravity's version, which on   first glance, I think is already going   to be better. It still looks a little   bit vibe cody, but we've got a really   nice I mean, look at that animation   there. That panel is nice.

 This thing is   floating. We've got some nice colors.   We've got some dynamic elements going on   in the background here. It feels like   there's more depth to it. Even these are   floating up as well. Um, let's keep on   going. We've got the two prices down   here. Got some nice colors. So, wait,   actually, let's see if we click in the   success stories.

 Okay, so this is still   all just a onepage landing page. Very   nice. Okay, so when we think about these   two, I would probably say that I prefer   the aura.ai. Think about the fact that   we only just said this much. We said,   "Hey, give us a landing page for a   premium AI automation course." And that   was basically it.

 So, at this point, you   guys have seen them go back and forth,   and we've seen them compared across   three different tests. So, it's time for   the final verdict. I'm sure you guys   already kind of can see the way that I'm   leaning, but let's dive in. So, after   that, let's talk about the results. In   test one, I preferred Claude Code's   logic, but I preferred anti-gravity's   design.

 I think Claude Code did a better   job of thinking through what we wanted   and thinking through kind of the user   journey and experience and then giving   us that tool that felt a little bit   better compared to anti-gravity felt a   little bit more limited. But, like I   said, I liked the way that   anti-gravity's design looked much more.   In test two, Claude Code definitely won.

  It was way more thoughtful. It had   sources. I thought the research even   looked better. So test two, I'm going to   give to Claude Code. And then in the   last test, Claude Code had better copy   and structure, but once again,   anti-gravity's design and overall feel   were much stronger. So what's   interesting here is there's a pattern,   right? I think that Claude Code thinks   better, but I think that anti-gravity   makes things look better.

 And Gemini is   also noticeably faster. You know, I'm   not typically working on things where   I'm extremely, you know, timesensitive.   So I don't mind if Opus is a little   slower, especially if it means that the   output is higher quality. And especially   with community skills and custom   instructions that you can give and push   into Claude Code's design, then   everything else that you're doing with   Claude Code can kind of fill those gaps   that Gemini might be able to give you.

  So kind of my rule of thumb would be use   anti-gravity if design and speed are   your priority or if you want to test out   something for free before you commit.   And use Cloud Code if you care about   real code quality, configurability, and   production reliability. Personally, I   use Cloud Code.

 The output quality and   the pace that they're shipping at right   now is just really hard to beat. What I   think is interesting is it's not always   a matter of which tool is better. You   know, this versus this, this kills this.   I think the real question that we should   be answering and asking is for this job,   which tool does this job the best? Or   which combination of different tools can   I use for different pieces of this job?   So, anyways, I hope that you guys found   this one helpful.

 I put everything that   we talked about today into a full   resource guide that you can grab for   completely free inside of my free school   community. The link for that is down in   the description. And if you're looking   to dive deeper and connect with   thousands of other people who are   building AI businesses, then check out   my plus community, also linked in the   description.

 But anyways, that is going   to do it for this one. If you guys   enjoyed, you learned something new,   please give it a like. It definitely   helps me out a ton. And as always, I   appreciate you guys making it to the end   of the video. I'll see you on the next   one. Thanks everyone.

In this course, you will learn about AI   assisted software development. I'm Bo KS   and I'm teaching this course. AI coding   tools are not just a trend or a gimmick.   They're genuinely transforming how   professional developers work. Studies   show that experienced developers can   have extreme productivity gains while   maintaining quality when they use these   tools effectively.

 But here's the key   word, effectively. You can't just   install an AI coding tool and expect   magic to happen. you need to understand   how these tools work, when to use them,   and perhaps more importantly, when not   to use them. So, what exactly are we   going to cover in this course? We're   going to start with the fundamentals.

  Understanding how AI models actually   work, what tokens are, why context   windows matter, and what hallucinations   mean in the AI world. Then we'll get   hands-on, taking you through the entire   coding life cycle from generation to   review. You will master AI pair   programming and Agentic terminal   workflows using top tier tools like   GitHub C-Pilot, Anthropics Claude Code,   and the Gemini CLI.

 The course also   covers open-source automation with   OpenClaw, teaching you how to set up a   highly customizable, locally hosted AI   assistant for your development   environment. Finally, you will learn how   to maintain high code quality and   streamline your team's workflow by   integrating code rabbit for automated   AIdriven pull request analysis.

 Code   Rabbit provided a grant to make this   course possible and it's a good addition   to your AI tool stack. So, let's talk   about who this course is for. This   course assumes you have some programming   experience. You don't need to be an   expert, but you should be comfortable   writing basic programs, know how to use   a code editor, and have a basic   understanding of Git.

 AI tools are most   powerful when you already understand the   fundamentals of coding. One more thing   before we dive in. Throughout this   course, I want you to actually code   along with me. Don't just watch. Open up   VS Code, install the tools I'm showing   you, and practice. The best way to learn   AI assisted coding is by doing it.

  You'll develop an intuition for what   works and what doesn't, and you'll find   your own workflow that fits how you like   to code. All right, let's get started   with the fundamentals.   Before we start using AI coding tools,   we need to understand some key terms.   These concepts will come up throughout   the course, and understanding them will   help you get better results from any AI   tool you use. First up, tokens.

 Think of   tokens as word pieces. They're how AI   reads your code and text. When you type   something to an AI, it doesn't see   individual characters or words the way   we do. It breaks everything down into   tokens. A token might be a word, part of   a word, a punctuation mark, or even a   space.

 The word function might be one   token, while functionalize might be   broken into multiple tokens. Why does   this matter? Because AI services often   have token limits. Free tiers limit how   many tokens you can use per day or   month. So, understanding tokens helps   you understand why sometimes you hit   limits and why longer prompts cost more.

  Next, a context window. The context   window is how much information the AI   can remember at once during a   conversation. Think of it like the AI's   short-term memory. If you have a small   context window, the AI can only consider   a small amount of code or conversation   at a time.

 With a larger context window,   the AI can understand more of your   project, remember earlier parts of your   conversation, and give more relevant   suggestions. Context windows are   measured in tokens. Uh, for example,   GPT4 has a context window of about   128,000 tokens. Claude has up to 200,000   tokens. Gemini can handle over a million   tokens.

 But when you watch this video, a   lot of these services may have even more   tokens they can handle. In practical   terms, this means some AI tools can   analyze your entire codebase at once,   while others can only look at a few   files at a time. Now, this is a really   important one. Hallucinations. A   hallucination is when the AI confidently   suggests something that's completely   wrong.

 It might make up a function that   doesn't exist or reference a library   that was deprecated years ago or even   invent API methods that never existed.   The AI doesn't know it's wrong. It's   just predicting what tokens are likely   to come next based on its training data.   Sometimes those predictions are spot-on   and sometimes they're completely made   up.

 This is why you should always verify   AI suggestions. Don't just accept code   blindly. You need to test it. You need   to check the documentation. You need to   make sure all the functions actually   exist. And then finally, prompts. A   prompt is a simple instructions,   a simple instruction to the AI. It could   be a comment in your code, a question in   a chat interface, or a detailed   description of what you want.

 The   quality of your prompts directly affects   the quality of AI responses. Vague   prompts get vague responses, but   specific detailed prompts get specific,   useful code. We'll talk more about   prompt engineering later, but for now,   you just need to remember that the   clearer you are about what you want, the   better results that you'll get.

 Okay,   let's talk about when you should use AI   assistance and when you should just code   things yourself. So AI is good for   writing boilerplate code like getters,   setters, basic CRUD application op   operations, uh learning new frameworks   or syntax, writing tests and   documentation, refactoring repetitive   patterns, getting unstuck on syntax   errors.

 But sometimes you need to code   yourself like when you're designing   system architecture, making security   critical decisions, writing complex   business logic, learning new concepts   for the first time or working on   performance critical optimizations.   Basically, you need to remember that you   need to use AI to speed up   implementation, but keep architectural   decisions to yourself.

 AI is great at   the how, how to implement something, how   to write the syntax, how to structure a   function, but you should be deciding the   what and why. What you're building and   why you're building it that way. Think   of AI as a very fast, very knowledgeable   junior developer. They can write code   quickly, but you need to review it,   guide the architecture, and make the   important decisions.

  Okay, time to get hands-on. I have uh VS   Code going right now and I'm going to   show you how to get GitHub Copilot set   up and how to use it. So, if you don't   already have VS Code installed, just   pause the video and go download it from   code.visisualstudio.com.   It's completely free. So, let's install   Copilot.

 Now, I'm going to go to this   extensions icon right here, and then I'm   just going to search for GitHub Copilot.   Now, an important note here, you may see   two extensions in the marketplace   uh because uh there there's an original   GitHub C-Pilot that's now deprecated.   What you want is GitHub Copilot chat.   So, I'm just going to click the install   button on GitHub Copilot Chat and then   it's going to install and then I'll see   this page here about the extension.

 So,   this is an all-in-one extension. There   used to be a few different ones. So,   this single extension now handles both   the chat and the code completions. So,   after it installs, you're going to have   to log in. It could come up with a login   page or you're going to have to click   this person icon.

 to the account icon in   here. And then we're going to sign in.   There's a few different ways to get   signed in. I'm going to click the backup   and sync settings. And then there's a   sign in button here. And then I'll sign   in with GitHub. Now, it's going to open   up a browser and it's going to have me   authorize with GitHub to sign in.

 So,   I'll just click continue here and then   authorize. And now, we'll go back into   Visual Studio Code. And now we can just   confirm that we're signed in to GitHub   Copilot. I'm going to go to manage   extension account preferences and go to   GitHub Copilot chat. And then I'm just   going to confirm that I'm using my   current account which is BOCS.

  Okay. Now you should see a GitHub   C-Pilot icon in the corner here. If you   don't, we can just rightclick on this   bar. I'm going to turn on C-pilot   status. And I can click here to finish   the setup. I'm just going to click on   use AI features and then this will   finish the setup of GitHub Copilot. And   now we're set up and we're we can now   see the chat in this right hand side of   the screen here.

 And we can actually   toggle the chat with this button in the   corner. So this is how we can basically   open the chat. So I can close the chat   with the X. I can open the chat by going   to that. And then we can actually do a   new chat, quick chat. There's a few   other things. Configure inline   suggestions.   And so now a little bit about pricing.

  So GitHub offers Copilot free, which is   super powerful. Basically, you get 2,000   code completions and 50 chat or agent   requests every month. If you're a   student, teacher, or open-source   maintainer, you can still get the pro   plan free, which gives you unlimited   completions and more advanced premium   models like GPD5 or Cloud 4.

 So, you can   always look into that if that's   something that you think that you would   be interested in. Okay, let's try out   our first AI suggestions. I'm going to   just create a new file. So, I will just   create a file called demo.j. JJS   and I'm going to close my chat for now.   So in this demo.js   um even though we only installed the   chat extension, our ghost text   completions are built right in.

 So if I   just put in a comment here function to   calculate   the area of a circle, you could see that   even while I was typing this comment, it   was suggesting the end of the comment.   So now that I see this, I can press   enter to accept one line or tab to   accept this entire function. So you can   see the gray text appear and when you   but it's temporary, but if you press   tab, it'll put the whole text in.

 And   this is a function to calculate the area   of a circle. I didn't even have to write   anything. And now let me show you a few   more examples. It's actually give me a   suggestion for another uh com inline   comment here. But I'm going to do   something else. I'm going to say   function to validate an email address   using reax.

 And if I just wait here,   it's going to suggest this whole   function here. validate email. So this   is a function with a proper reax pattern   which is pretty impressive. So I'll just   press tab here to select it. Now I'm   going to try another one uh something   even more complex function to fetch data   from an API and I'll just and log the   response.

 Now it's just showing the   beginning of this right now. So I   pressed enter and it's giving me async   function fetch data URL. If I hover over   this, it's going to show me uh some   options. So right now it's only giving   one out of one option. So there's only   one option to accept. But let me show   you something.

 I'm going to press tab to   accept this option. Press tab to accept   this option. And now I press enter. I   haven't pressed tab. But if I hover over   this, we can also just instead of   accepting the whole option, accept one   word at a time. So it's going to either   be command or alt and then the arrow   button.

 So basically I'm just accepting   one word at a time here. And now it's   giving me the rest of the function. Now   if I hover over this again, I can see it   says one out of three. That means there   are three different options I can   accept. See, I can just scroll through   these three different possible codes   that it's giving me.

 And there's also   the shortcut. If you kind of hover over   this, it shows you the shortcut. So,   it's either going to be alt bracket or   it's going to be your option bracket,   uh, depending on if you have Mac or   Windows. So, I can just scroll through   these just with my shortcut keys on my   keyboard.

 So, that's pretty nice because   Copilot doesn't always know exactly what   you want, but it may have a few   different options. And then once you   find the one you like, you just press   tab to select it. So, basically, you can   choose the code that fits that best fits   your coding style or project needs.   Okay.

 Now, I'm going to give you another   pro tip that's going to dramatically   improve your suggestions. It's the   neighboring tabs trick. So, let me   create a few more files really quick.   Okay. So, let's see what I've just set   up. I have a user test.js with a test   for our users. I have a users.css   with some styling for our users. And now   I'm just going to go into our user.

js   file. And we're going to see that   basically AI has a limited context   window, a short-term memory of what   you're working on. And by default,   Copilot looks in the file you're   currently typing in, but it also scans   the other tabs you have open in VS Code.   So to really understand this example, I   just want to show you just one more time   the user.

est   basically I'm using for looking for a   specific data uh test ID called user   card name. So now what hap let's see   what's happen I go back into users.js.   I'm going to import my users.css file.   It's going to automatically fill in   users.css CSS and it's going to suggest   a function.

 I'm going to fill in that   function, but I'm also going to pass in   an avatar URL. And then see, you can   basically se uh use the autocomp   completion and then go in and make some   changes. And now look, it's giving me an   entire suggestion. And I'm just going to   put tab to fill this in. And you can see   it's getting the classes from our CSS   and it's adding this test ID user card   name.

 So it's getting the classes that   we create right in the CSS and it knows   to use the test ID user card name. And   then so that's exactly what we want and   it it figure out the context based on   our other files. So without those tabs   open, Copilot might suggest a generic   name like container or user box. But   with the files, it knew what we actually   needed.

 Okay, let's do a quick practice   exercise together. I'm going to create a   new file. This one's going to be called   to-do.js.   And we'll just close all these other   files we have open. Okay, just let's   just start with this comment. to-do app   with add, remove, and list functions.   And then I'll just press enter here. And   look, it it knows that I want to start   with an array.

 So I'll just press tab to   set that. Plus, let's just make sure I   spell functions right up here. And then   it's automatically   I don't even have to give it another   comment. It's already saying function   add to-do. So I'll just press tab to   accept that. Now it's filling in the   function. I just press tab to accept   that.

 Now it's giving me my remove   function. So I press tab to select that.   And now it's giving me my list function.   So I press tab to accept that. And   basically in just a few seconds we got a   basic to-do app structure. And all I had   to do was add that comment at the very   beginning. Of course, you'd want to test   this and make sure it works the way you   expect, but AI just saved us a lot of   typing.

 Okay, now that we got the basics   down, let's unlock the true powerful   features of GitHub Copilot. So, Copilot   isn't just a code completer. It's   basically a full-on development partner.   So, we're going to cover the three main   interaction modes, the model selection,   and how to give C-Pilot a rule book for   your specific project.

 GitHub Copilot   now categorizes your quest into three   distinct modes. So as mode is the   default. It's great for questions,   explanations, and learning. Edit mode   spec is specifically for refactoring and   making spec direct changes to your   existing files with a clear diff view.   And then agent mode is is the autonomous   mode.

 This is where Copilot plans and   executes multi-step tasks across your   entire repository. Knowing when to   switch between these will keep you from   getting AI hallucinations and knowing   your code stays clean. And again, this   is all in the chat, which I'm just about   to show you about. So, let me   demonstrate how these actually feel in   practice.

 So, I'm going to open the main   chat. We can click this chat button up   here, or we can do control alt I or   command alt I depending on if you have   Windows or Mac. So, I just did command   alt I and I got this chat session here.   I'll close this. So after we open this   chat window, notice this dropdown right   here.

 We have a we can change the mode   from agent mode, ask mode or edit mode   or plan mode. So I'm going to go to ask   mode. Also, we can select different   LLMs or models that we want to use for   the request. And so we're in ask mode.   So in ask mode, I can be very broad. So   I can at say something like what does   the reduce method do in JavaScript and   how does it compare to a for loop and   then I can send that and then it's just   going to do some thinking and this   working section this is basically what   it's thinking to itself before it comes   up with the answer. Okay, so now it it   came up with the answer.   Array.prototype.reduce runs reducer   function across an array of elements. So   it gives it signatures, it key   behaviors, when to use versus a for   loop, and it even gives some examples.   So it's basically a tutorial style

  response. It's a safe mode because it's   not going to change a single line of my   code unless I manually copy it out. And   you can get into this ask mode just from   or your file. Like let's say you have a   function here. I can right click on here   and then go to explain. And basically   now it's going to um use the ask mode to   explain a function in my code and it's   going to break down the logic for me.

 So   here's the explanation of that code. So   this is another example of how to use   ask mode and it can help you explain   code that you're working in. Okay, I'm   just going to go up here and start a new   chat or you can always just keep using   the same chat. But basically now I'm   going to go into edit mode.

 So this is   where you know you want to change   something. So I'm going to look at this   code here and you can see it's already   added the file the current file context.   It's giving the current file context to   the chat. And this is basically an old   callbackbased   function. So I'm going to say refactor   to async a wait and add a 5-second   timeout. And we just wait.

 And we're   going to just watch the editor.   Basically, instead of just giving a   block of code on the sidebar, it applies   the changes directly to my file in a   diff view. I can see the old code in red   and the new code in green. And then I   can review every single line and click   apply or discard or actually keep or   undo. So I'm just going to press keep.

  And so this is the fastest way to   refactor. And I kept the the new code   here which is going to be a lot more   robust than my previous code. Okay. I   could continue along with in agent mode   in this chat, but I sometimes if I'm   doing something all something completely   different, I like starting a new chat.

  And now I'm going to go into   agent mode. So you can see it says   describe what to build next. So agent   mode does more than just write code.   It's going to think and it's going to   act. So I can give it a massive task.   So I'm saying create a full rest API   with express that has JWT authentication   and saves users to a local SQLite   database and then just start.

 Now we're   going to watch the sidebar and so it's   going to start by doing all the planning   here and basically it's going after it   creates the the plan it can actually   create new files install the necessary   mpm packages to my terminal write   middleware. It can even run a test build   to make sure its own code doesn't have   any syntax errors.

 So you can see it's   now created a plan and it's going to   work to implement the plan. And as it   goes, we are going to have to basically   um give it some feedback. So it says   allow edit to sensitive files. The model   wants to edit package.json.   So I'm just going to click allow. And   you can see it's now generating all   these files right in our project   directory.

 And as it work as it's   working, we can see it has a little icon   under the different things that's been   created. So we can go through and just   like check in on the code that's being   created. So it's even creating folders,   directories within the folders. And so   we'll just let this work for a little   bit and then come back once it's uh   finished.

 Okay, now it basically just   finished. It says what it's done. It it   it says what it builds, the files it   added. Next step, run install and start   the server locally. It gives us the   commands to run and then some test   examples, how to log in. So now we can   try that. First, let me just keep all   these changes.

 And it says, "What would   you like me to do?" Yes, install and   start server. So now we will be able to   see whether it can actually run things   in the terminal right from the agent.   And anytime it's going to run a command,   we're often going to have to allow it.   So now it's doing mpm install. And   instead of clicking allow, I can enable   auto approve.

 So now it'll just   automatically allow everything. Now this   is more risky, but for now I am going to   do that.   And uh it's suggest um it just wants to   make sure we really want to do this. And   yeah, I'll trust it. So now it's   actually seeing that there's some server   issues and it's just going to go along   and try to fix all the issues itself.

 So   it's going to ask some questions along   the way and continue to try to kind of   figure out things and get everything   working. So, we just created an entire   working application. And so, while   agents are powerful, they're not magic.   So, you always want to look at the plan   it generates and just make sure it   doesn't go too wild on your code base.

  And next, I want to talk to you about   repository customization. You can   actually train Copilot on your project's   rules using a special file. So instead   of telling copilot every time to use   typescript or use functional components,   you can make this file called GitHub or   copilot instructions and then you can   just put the instructions here and then   it will use all these instructions   whenever it's working.

 Also, you don't   even have to write this file yourself   anymore. What I can do is just go into   chat and just put slashinit. And this is   going to generate or update work   workplace instructions. And then I just   run that. And now it's going to scan my   project. It's going to basically figure   out what I'm using.

 And it's going to   generate custom a customized instruction   file for me. So now every suggestion it   gives will automatically follow the   project's specific naming conventions   and style guidelines. In this case, it's   creating instructions based on the   application that it created, but it's   still a good example of how you can   create these instructions.

 So I can go   here and then I can see the instructions   that it created. So these are the   instructions it created based on this   application and so I can go through and   always change things like maybe it says   always use JWT secret for environment   from environment and changes that sign   or verify tokens.

 I could change that to   use something else. Maybe I don't want   to use SQL SQL light. I can change so it   uses what I want to use. Okay. Now I'm   going to talk about participants and   slash commands. So think of participants   as department heads. Basically we we   would put this into the chat. So I can   do at workspace when we want when we   have a question about the whole project.

  So let me show you an example of that.   So it' say at work workspace where is   the database connection defined? So   basically it's looking through our whole   project to find this information. So the   database connection is defined in DB.js   s as the endpoint DB instance the user   model imports and then it can answer a   question and then you would use at   terminal to ask how to do things in the   command line like maybe like how to how   do I terminal how do I prune my docker   images we can use at vs code to um   basically do something associ that's   directly related to VS code like set up   debugging for node another thing would   be at gith GitHub at GitHub is a new   thing that lets you search your PRs and   issues directly from VS Code. And then   we al also have our slashcomands

  slashdoc generate documentation   slashexplain explain the codefix to fix   errors in the selection slash test   generate unit test new create a new   project structure. So right now I don't   have any tests. So I'm just going to   type in slash tests. And it says it   looks like you may not have test set up   in this repository.

 Would you like to   set them up? And accept. So now it's   just going to go and create all the   tests for this project. And then I have   the option, do I want to use or Mocha?   For the test I will use just there's   just basically two different JavaScript   testing frameworks. And it's just going   to go and ask me questions anytime it   needs some user input.

  Okay. Now, let's talk more about code   rabbit. Automated code review is one of   the more valuable uses of AI in the   development workflow. Think about it.   How many times have you pushed code,   waited a day or two for a code review,   then had to context switch back to fix   issues? With AI code review, you get   feedback in minutes while the code is   still fresh in your mind.

 So, what is   Code Rabbit? So, Code Rabbit is an AI   powered code review platform. It has So,   here's some of the things it does. We   have automatic PR reviews. The moment   you create a pull request, Code Rabbit   analyzes your changes, security   analysis. It catches vulnerabilities   before they reach production.

 Also, code   quality suggestions, not just bugs, but   ways to make your code better. Natural   language chat, you can discuss if the   feedback right in the PR comments. Also,   it's a learning system. It learns your   code base and code patterns over time.   It integrates with GitHub, GitLab,   um I mean GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure   DevOps.

 If you use any of those   platforms, you can use Code Rabbit. So,   let me explain the workflow. First, you   create a poll request. Then, Code Rabbit   automatically kicks off a review. Then   within the minutes within minutes within   minutes you get a summary of your   changes identified issues with severity   levels specific suggestions for   improvements security vulnerability   alerts.

 Then step four you can chat with   code rabbit to ask questions or request   clarifications.   And then finally when you push new   commits code rabbit does incremental   reviews. And then there's going to be   different review types based on the   severity all the way um from critical   which are severe issues that may cause   failure or security breaches all the way   down to trivial which are low impact   quality improvements.

 So let me show you   code rabbit in action. I have this   sample project here called techart. It's   basically a simple e-commerce API built   with ExpressJS   I have on GitHub, but here is it running   locally on my computer. Basically,   there's all these products you can add   to your cart. And once you add to your   cart, you can see them over in the cart   here. over here.

 You can sort by price,   you can sort by category, you can sort   by   low to high, and then it's like I said,   just a e-commerce site. So, let's start   by setting up Code Rabbit. So, I'm over   on Code Rabbit AI, code rabbit.ai,   and I will you can either log in or get   a free trial. You want to connect your   GitHub to Code Rabbit because it's going   to work right through your through   GitHub.

 So, I'm just going to authorize   Code Rabbit. And then I'll get this   installed. And I can either um authorize   install for all repositories or specific   ones. Since I'm just using one for this   tutorial, I'm just going to authorize it   for a specific one. And I'll go to   techmart and install and authorize.   And it's always good to have two-factor   authentication on GitHub and any other   important website.

 And that's pretty   much it for the setup. Now, if we   already had PRs on this repo, then we   could review a PR right here. But we   don't yet. I'm going to be making one.   So, let's skip to the app. Okay. So, the   setup is complete and Code Rabbit is now   watching for poll requests. So, let's   simulate a real development scenario.

 I   have my code here in VS Code. I'm going   to add a discount code feature to this   e-commerce app, and I'm intentionally   going to make some mistakes that   developers commonly make, the kind of   things that slip through when you're   coding quickly. So, let me create a new   branch.

 So, it's just going to be called   feature/disountcodes.   And now, I will create a new file called   discount service.js. JS this will handle   our discount code logic and I'll just   paste in some code some code here we   have an inmemory discount codes um we   have again it would be a database in   production but this is just an example   we have admin credentials and then we   have the code to apply a discount code   to cart not going to review this in   detail because that's not the point of   this tutorial but we have a route to   create a new discount ount code to   delete discount codes and to search the   discount codes for autocompletes. So   I'll save that and then I'm going to   update our server.js.   So we want to be able to use the route.   So I'm going to require a discount

  service and then I'm going to get get   the use the route here the the   API/disounts.   Okay. Okay, now down in the terminal,   I'm just going to commit this and create   a pull request. So, get add and then I   will get commit with this message about   adding a discount code. And then I'll   just push it.

 So, I'll just push that to   GitHub. Now, I'll just go over GitHub   and create a pull request. And I'll add   a very simple description, not what you   would normally do, but for this example,   I will create this pull request. So now   we just can wait here and you can see   it's doing some checks and so we just   have to wait a minute or two and then   code rabbit starts its review and it's   currently processing the new changes and   gives us this cool little uh asky art   here.

 Code rabbit just finished up and   look at this. It so what it does first   is it generates a summary of exactly   what the PR does. added discount code   functionality. Introduce admin panel for   managing discount codes, discount code   support, expiration tracking to control   validity periods. So that's kind of nice   to get a summary of what the commit is   of what the PR is.

 But here's where it   gets interesting. If we scroll down a   little bit here, we are going to find   the issues. So first it has a nitpick   comment creation currently accepts   accepts empty invalid code. So basically   something that you could change, but   it's not super important. And then   prompt for all review comments with AI   agents.

 So uh if an AI agent is going to   be looking through this, but look at   this. We we got some issues. So it's   going to uh each there it's going to be   different types of issues and it's going   to use a color and a word like this to   tell us what type of issue. This is a   major issue. Remove the hard-coded admin   password.

 Hard coding secrets and code   is a security risk that makes rotation   difficult. So obviously no one's going   to put an admin password in code   probably not. But you may accidentally   put some keys or some other hard-coded   information and this is going to find it   and it's going to give us a proposed fix   and even the code that we need to to do   to fix it and then some commitable   suggestions.

 So I can just click commit   suggestion. I can just click commit   suggestion just like this and it's now   going to add the change there. And then   we can scroll down. It's going to find   another issue here. So it says this is a   another major issue. Don't trust client   supplied totals. Validate inputs and   clamp totals.

 So basically this is   accepting cart total from the client   which can be manipulated. This can   should be computed server side. So now   it's going to give us some suggestions   for how to fix this. So we could fix it   right here if we wanted with this   commitable suggestion. Uh I'm going to   skip that for now because you already   know how that works.

 And now we have a   critical issue. This is even worse.   Protect admin list uh delete endpoints.   They're currently unauthenticated.   So someone can access this these admin   in endpoints without being   authenticated. anyone can enumerate or   delete discount codes. So that's   obviously very bad. We go down here and   we see now this is just a minor issue.

  Um so this just says remove or properly   input search discount. It's dead code   with unfixed bugs. So we can see it's   going to give us some different things   that we need to do to fix this. And one   thing cool is that we can actually um   chat with code rabbit right in in the   PR.

 So here I can say something like   this is the authentication problem. I   can say at code at code rabbit AI can   you show me how to properly secure these   admin endpoints using middleware and   then comment here and then I had to   refresh it and now we can see the code   rabbit's response. I'll show you how to   create an authentication middleware for   securing your admin endpoints.

 Here's a   clean approach. And now it's going to   give the complete approach of how it's   going to do it. Some benefits, some   alternatives.   And we didn't necessarily have to do   this in this case because we could have   also looked at this example fix. But you   can see now it's giving us a much more   indepth solution of how to fix this.

 And   we can also use commands to interact   with code rabbit. So if I do atcode   rabbit ai summary, this is going to   regenerate the PR summary. And then we   can see I just refresh and it comes in   here. Summary regeneration triggered.   And we can see it's going to be a little   different the summary up here.

 We also   can do code rabbit AI resolve to mark to   mark resolve comments. And we can do   code rabbit AI generate doc strings. And   this is going to add documentation.   It's basically going to   um add generate documentation for for   the discount functions. And we can see   now it says dock string generation in   progress.

 So you can see it added a   commit that references pull request. And   then also basically it's creating a new   PR. So once I'm done going through all   this and choosing whether I want to   basically resolve the conversation if I   want to uh implement these commitable   suggestions and also it does warns you   review the code before committing but uh   in this case I'm just going to commit   that suggestion and then once you're   ready you can just merge the poll   request and then I'll just confirm the   merge here. I can go over to the dock   stream string one that was created and   we can go to file changed and we can see   we have doc strings on these this   function here. And if we go down we can   see that this time the review was   skipped because it was authored by the

  user configured for code rabbit reviews.   So basically it it um by default code   rabbit skips reviewing PRs authored by   itself. So I can just merge that pull   request. So here are some key code   rabbit commands you should know. I   talked about a little but we have pause   which will pause automatic reviews.

  Resume resume automatic reviews. Uh   review which is going to request an   incremental review. Full review which   completes a new review. Then we have   summary which we already saw that   updates the PR summary con resolve which   will mark resolved com comments. Then we   can show the configur the configuration.

  We can show the command reference. We   can we already show generating   documentation. We can generate a   sequence diagramgram which is basically   a way to visualize the code flow and   then we can help plan the   implementation.   Now we can also customize code rabbit's   behavior with a code rabbit.

yaml file in   the repository root. So I can just add   code rabbit.yaml.   So here's an example of our   configuration file. So the profile   setting is interesting. So chill is   going to focus on important issues,   fewer nitpicks. But if we change it to   assertive, it's going to be more   thorough and include style suggestions.

  And then we have some other other ones   like request change workflow we don't   false high level summary true auto   review enabled but for drafts it's   false. Uh chat auto replay true. So you   can basically set it to behave how you   want. Now as far as the profile uh like   for production repository I recommended   assertive mode but for personal projects   or learning chill is going to work   great.

 Now code rabbit has a CLI tool   that lets you get reviews before you   even commit. You can install with   homebrew mpm. Then you just have to   authenticate and then you can uh use it   to do an interactive review and then   also get basically plain text output or   you can get your um an output for AI   agents. So I'll do brewtap code rabbit   AI tap and then I'll just do brew   install code rabbit and I'll do code   rabbit o to get authenticated actually   off login.

  So I'll just log in here. Okay, I'm   logged in. And now I can just call do   code rabbit right from the command line.   Code rabbit. And it's going to be   reviewing the same the same code changes   that we were reviewing on the website   because I haven't pulled down all of the   fixes onto my local repository.

 So we   can just see how it can review all those   same things but locally. Okay, now it   has found these problems. The critical   bug, hard-coded credentials and source   code, missing a weight and reference,   non-existent endpoint, missing input   validation, and then some of them are   critical.

 So now if I just go into it,   we can see what the problem is. And we   have a chance to um close this. We can   apply. So we see so if we press A it   will just apply the suggestion or we can   copy the prompt to fix with AI or R   would be to reject the commit. So I'll   just apply this suggestion. Oh I guess   this this in this case it didn't have a   suggestion but I know some of them do.

  So if I go up to this critical one I can   apply this suggestion and you can see   this applied and committed the   suggestion. We have a green dot because   that one was uh committed. And we can   also apply this suggestion. Okay. Again,   no suggestion to apply. Sometimes   there's the the they they have   suggestions, sometimes they don't.

 But   um it will tell us what to do to fix it   if it doesn't have the suggestion. And   we can always copy this prompt to fix it   with AI. So let me show you how that   would work. So this is says missing a   way and references non-existent   endpoint. And so what I'm going to do is   just press C to copy the prompt to fix   with AI.

 And here is the the prompt that   it's going to copy. Now I can just open   my chat over here and then I'm just   going to paste in that prompt and then I   will submit it. So this is how we can   use one AI code rabbit to find the the   bugs and then we can use another AI   GitHub Copilot to fix the bugs. So some   of them we're going to be able to   basically apply a fix right from Code   Rabbit but some of them will be a little   more complex.

 So we can use GitHub   Copilot to do the fixes here. Okay. Now   it gives a summary of the changes. We   can actually look at what the changes   here are here and we can see that it   made the changes based on the problem   that code rabbit found. So we can keep   those changes and we can basically just   keep doing that using our GitHub copilot   or another AI agent to to fix things.

  And there's even a faster way to go   about that. So, I'm going to just close   out of code rabbit. And this time I'm   going to call I'm going to run code   rabbit again, but I'm going to put   prompt only. So now it's not going to   have that visual mode. It's not going to   give you a chance to it's not going to   tell you what's wrong.

 It's not going to   give you a chance to apply changes. It's   just going to give us the prompt that we   need to give to GitHub Copilot or give   to another AI agent so it can do all the   fixes on its own. Cuz honestly, uh, if   I'm just trying to move quickly,   especially if it's like just a simple   personal project, uh, I don't really   care what the problems are or why   they're they're problems.

 I just want   them fixed. So, in this way, we can get   the prompt to just give right to the AI   and then it will fix it. And while we're   waiting um for this to give us the   prompt to give to the AI, I want to tell   you about how you can even automate this   process. So I could just go into my AI   and just and just say this implement the   discount code feature, then run code   rabbit-prompt-on   and fix any issues it finds.

 So now it   knows to implement the discount code   feature and then it can just run the AI   the AI agent can just run code rabbit on   its own and then find the problems and   fix the problems. So okay but now it   this is finished running. So it it gives   us the prompt that we can just copy and   we can paste into the agent.

 But when we   actually just tell the AI agent to use   code rabbit, this creates a powerful   feedback loop where your AI assistant   writes code and code rabbit quality   checks it. It's basically like having   two AI assistants collaborating. So one   writes and one reviews. So it's going   through right now just to write write   the code based on the code rabbit review   that we already got.

 We just covered   Code Rabbit's core code review features,   the CLI, and how it works with AI   agents. But Code Rabbit has been   shipping some powerful new features, and   I want to demo the ones I think are the   most useful. Code rabbit plan, premerge   checks, and some advanced CLI workflows.   First up is Code Rabbit Plan.

 The idea   is simple. Before you write any code,   you create a plan. You describe what you   want in a GitHub issue and Code Rabbit   analyzes your codebase and generates a   detailed coding plan. Let me show you   how it works. So, I got a GitHub issue   here on my TechMart demo repo. It says   users should be able to save products,   their personal wish list, view their   wish list, and so on. Now, watch this.

  I'm going to create a new comment at   code rabbit AI plan and then I'll just   comment that. And so now code rabbit is   going to start analyzing my entire   codebase and generate a coding plan.   Okay, now it finished creating a plan.   So we have a summary of the plan and   then it's going to give us some design   choices some and even some different   options that we can use and then it's   going to give some imple some exact   implementation steps.

 So task one wish   list status storage structure and then   what we have to do then what we have to   do for task two all the different things   we have to implement and so on and then   we also have the phase two frontend wish   list experience and it's going to give   us some everything we have to do and   then if we scroll a little bit we can   see the prompt for AI agents so   basically we can just copy this prompt   for AI agents to write all the code we   And same with here we have another   prompt for AI agents.

 And then we have   the research. We also have our next   steps. So this is going to combine all   we can have basically all of our prompts   in one. And then we can it says we can   iterate on the plan uh continue to kind   of get some more feedback. So basically,   instead of telling an AI agent, add a   wish list feature and hoping it figures   out your architecture, you give it this   contextrich plan.

 The agent knows   exactly which files to modify, which   patterns to follow, and what the   acceptance criteria are. You can also   reply to this comment. We could reply   here, and we can refine the plan. So   like if I disagree with the design   choice, I could just say so and code   rabbit will update it. And this works   with GitHub issues, GitLab, Jira, and   linear.

 You can even set it to auto   plan. Anytime you add a feature label to   an issue, it automatically generates a   plan. Next, I want to talk about   premerge checks. This turns Code Rabbit   from a helpful reviewer into an actual   quality gate that can block bad PRs from   merging. Let me show you a real example.   I've already created a PR on TechMart   that adds a loyalty program feature.

 But   before we look at the PR, let me show   you how to turn on premerge check. So in   Code Rabbit, you can go to configuration   and then click review and then we can   click premerge checks. And this is where   you would turn it on. You do need the   pro mode to turn it on, but you can   still create a check even if you don't   have pro mode on.

 You just have to start   the check manually. So to ch start the   check manually, we just go to our poll   request and then we just comment code AI   review and I comment on that and it's   going to do the check. Now, if we had   premerge checks enabled, it would   automatically start that without having   to comment this.

 And we can see that   this PR isn't very good. Uh, the title   just says stuff and the description just   says some changes and the code has some   issues. Okay, it finished up and it has   this walkth through of what's going on   and then it finds some problems   like that there's a bad title and how we   should replace the title.

 We also have   some checks here. These are actually um   the description is checked because there   is a summary automatically added here.   So, it's going to basically fix our bad   description and put in an all new   summary of what happened. And then we   have all these actionable   uh fixes. So, all these issues just like   what we've seen before.

 And not only do   we have the issues, we have the prompt   that we can um uh use with our AI   agents. And you can see it's finding all   the issues in the code. So you can set   this up so it runs this automatically on   every pull request. A pre-check. I also   want to mention multi-reo analysis. This   is for teams that have multiple repos   that depend on each other like a backend   API and a front-end app in separate   repos.

 you link them in code rabbit's   settings either through the web   interface or in your.code rabbit.yaml.   So in your code rabbit.yaml you're just   going to specify the repository that is   linked. So now when someone changes an   API endpoint in the backend repo code   rabbit checks the front-end repo and   says hey the front end is consuming this   endpoint and your change will break it.

  Those findings show up right in the PR   review. So if you work with   microservices or separate front-end   backend repos, this can be a gamecher   and it's available on the pro plan. Now   I'm going to show you the CLI in in   action with some advanced workflows. So   earlier we covered the basics, but let   me show you the real power which is   using it as a quality gate for code   you're actively writing.

 So I have some   uncommitted changes. this rewards   calculator.js file. I'm going to   actually run code rabbit before I've   even committed anything. So in the   terminal, I'll just run code rabbit. And   I already know there's been some files   that have changed. So I'll just hit   enter to get into the review. And you   can see code rabbit is going to find   some issues right uh before we even   commit the code.

 So that can be nice   when you're actually in development. And   just like before, you can uh copy the   prompt to fix with AI. So basically get   into this generate, review, fix loop.   And one last thing I want to talk about   with code rabbit. An independent company   called Martian recently published the   first rigorous benchmark for AI code   review tools.

 It's called the code   review bench and they tested 13   different tools. So you can see all   these tools including code rabbit uh   gemini code cloud cursor and code rabbit   is at the very top. So it ranked number   one in its F1 score which measures   measures the balance of catching real   issues without giving you false   positives.

 So this was across nearly   300,000 poll requests. And it's a   completely independent organization not   associated with code rabbit. So that's   code rabbit. To summarize, it   automatically reviews every PR you   create, catches security issues, bugs,   and code quality problems. You can chat   with it to discuss feedback. The CLI   lets you review before you commit.

 And   it integrates with AI coding agents for   automated quality control.   Okay. Okay, now let's talk about command   line AI tools. These are powerful   alternatives to IDE based tools like   C-Pilot. We'll focus on two, Clog Code   and Gemini CLI. So why use uh CLI tools?   Well, they're more powerful autonomous   cap.

 They have more powerful autonomous   capabilities. They're better for   terminalheavy workflows.   They're they often have larger context   windows and they're great for system   administration and devops. So cloud code   from anthropic I think is good for   complex reasoning tasks. So we can   install with this npm install and then   just anthropic-ai/cloud-code.

  Now cloud code requires a claude pro   subscription or API credits. There's no   free tier, but it's worth it for the   capabilities.   We can start an interactive session just   by typing in claude.   And then we are going to just basically   do some setup and we're going to have to   log in.

 So, it brought me to a website   that I just had to authenticate on. And   now login is successful. So, we can just   go through the rest of the setup. Okay.   Now I can start talking to Claude. So   let's just start with this. Analyze this   codebase and suggest improvements. And   we're still using the TechMart codebase.   So Claude is reading through the files   trying to understand the architecture   and then eventually it should give us   some recommendations.

 So it's continuing   through reading the different files in   the codebase. And here is the overview.   So it gives the overview and then it   gives some issues. Um some of the issues   are some issues that we already knew   about but then it also gives some   additional things such as this race   condition user ID collection on   registration.

 Uh cart can reference   deleted invalid products. Um, and it has   some information about the architecture,   the code quality, error handling,   and it it even has some information   about the front end and some missing   features. And then it gives a summary of   the top five things. And some of this   stuff we knew from some of our uh from   earlier in this course, but some of it's   all new, like the course allows all   origins with credentials.

 And then I can   just ask it to fix. I can say yes,   please fix all five. And then we can go,   we can see that it's going to just think   through this. It makes a list of things   it's working on. And then it starts   working on everything. And then I'm   going to say yes, allow all edits during   this session.

 So it's just going to make   all the changes. And now we can watch it   as it basically makes all the changes   right within the terminal. And now we   can give it permission to run bash   commands. It's going to basically   install b-crypt. So that's one great   thing about the CLI is that it can   actually do things right within the the   terminal and run different commands.

 Now   clog code actually has different   thinking modes for different levels of   analysis. So when we're giving it   commands, we can tell it think for quick   an analysis, think hard deep reasoning,   think harder, and ultra think for   maximum depth analysis. We basically   just tell it ultra think, and then we   would tell it what to do.

 And then Cloud   would spend more time reasoning uh   through the problem before responding.   Okay, now it's done. And it would give   the summary of all the changes and it   tells what what it changed and the files   that it changed. Basically, it just did   everything. Now, we could also within   our project directory, we could make a   file called claude.

md   and then we can give claude context. So,   basically we could say what type of   application we're using, what kind of   technology we're using, um different   coding standards, the project structure.   We could just put this all in basically   in plain English. So it has it could   understand the project and conventions   and then would follow them and the   suggestions.

 So here's like an overview   of what I was talking about with claude   and we can also resume a pre I didn't   say this but we can resume a previous   session with the claude dash resume. And   then here's the different thinking modes   I was talking about. Now let's talk   about the Gemini CLI. Google's Gemini   CLI has some unique advantages.

 There's   a massive context window with over 1   million tokens. There's a good free tier   with 1,000 messages per day and it's   multimodal. It can process images. So to   install Google Gemini, we'll just do mpm   install-g   and Google Gemini CLI and then we can   log in with Gemini O login. Then we have   a little setup here and we'll log in   with Google and then it's just going to   open the authentication page in my   browser which I have on my other screen   but it's pretty straightforward.

 Okay,   I've successfully   logged in and we need to restart. And   it's right now just going through and   learning about my application. And it   gives us tips for getting started up   here. Uh including creating a Gemini MD   kind of like our cloud MD to customize   interactions. And it's just basically   exploring our codebase to start off   with.

 And it's actually running the   application and just testing it out. And   I haven't even done anything. It's just   I haven't given any commands. It's just   trying to figure out on its own how   everything works. So it successfully   logged into the demo account and   verified the session and basically just   actually ran the whole account.

 I didn't   even tell it the whole application and   logged in and everything. And basically   just like claude CLI, I can just type in   any message, give it any commands and it   will just update all the files. One   thing about amazing about Gemini is that   you can show it images and we'll   understand them.

 You can basically like   if you have a sketch of a UI on paper,   you can send the photo and ask it to   turn into a React component or I'm going   to try something. I'm going to take a   screenshot of this keyboard and I've put   that screenshot into this folder the   Ziotechart   and I'm going to give it a command. So   I'm saying find the product image from   the screenshot and add two more keys and   I'm passing in the keyboard.

 So right   now we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 or 1 2 3 4 5 6   7 8 nine keys on the keyboard. Let's see   if it can actually add more keys to the   keyboard. It is just an SVG. So, I'm   seeing if it can get that image and   figure out what SVG that that images of   and then add the keys to the the SVG.   And then it's giving me some options of   what I want it to do.

 It's it's asking   what I want to do. I'm going to enter   custom value and I'm going to say update   the SVG file to add more keys to the   image. Now, I'm not sure if it actually   read the PNG file or if it just happened   to find the keyboard.svg because it was   the same. It still uh started with   keyboard.

 But let's see if it's actually   able to add keys to that image to the   SVG file. Oh, good. It gives me a little   joke while while we're waiting. And I'll   just say to allow the change. And I   think this could be adding the keys to   the file. Okay, now let's check again.   So, we have eight keys. I'm going to   refresh. And there's 10 keys. It worked.

  It added two more keys to this keyboard.   Okay. So, it didn't actually read the   screenshot like I was hoping, but it   still managed to do what I wanted. And   it does have the ability to to read   images. So, both Clog Code and Gemini   CLI are both great for different   reasons.

 Honestly, I do like clog code   better, but um you do have to pay uh you   have to get a good plan to make it work   the in the best way. Okay, now I want to   show you something different.   We've talked about AI that helps you   write code, but what about an AI that   you that can actually do things for you?   So, OpenClaw is an open-source personal   AI assistant that runs on your own   computer.

  It's a little bit like having a junior   developer who never sleeps, can use any   tool, and remembers everything you've   told it. I've been using it personally   and I have been really liking it. It's   been helping me with a lot of things.   Here's what makes OpenCloud different   from other AI tools.

 First, it's always   available. You can message it from   WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or any chat   app you already use. It's like texting a   co-orker who happens to have access to   your computer. Second, it has persistent   memory. Unlike chat GPT where you start   fresh each conversation, OpenCloud   remembers context 24/7.

 It knows your   projects, your preferences, your ongoing   tasks. Now, the memory isn't perfect,   but it's better than some of the other   tools. Third, it can actually take   actions. It can run commands, open   browsers, manage files, deploy projects,   even send emails. For developers   specifically, OpenClaw is powerful   because it can run tests and fix failing   ones automatically.

  It can manage cloud code or codec   sessions from your phone, check your   GitHub notifications and respond to   issues, deploy code to staging or   production, monitor your services and   alert you to problems. Imagine you're on   a walk and you get a notification that   tests are failing. You just text your   OpenClaw, fix the failing test, and open   a PR.

 It does the work while you finish   your walk. So, here's the OpenClaw   website. Now, the setup is very   straightforward because it you just go   to the website and it gives you   basically the quick start, the one line,   and then you just have to run this on   whatever computer you want to set it up   on. Basically, it runs it can run on   your laptop, Mac Mini, a cloud VM.

 Uh   you can configure which chat services to   connect, set up your API keys, and start   chatting. So, I'm not going to go   through the whole setup because it's   very straightforward, but I'll show you   how it works because I already have it   set up on my computer. I have a laptop,   but I also have another Mac computer.

  And I have OpenCloth set up on my other   Mac computer. Um, I guess it's I it's   really a Mac Studio, not a Mac Mini, but   you can run on a lot of different types   of uh computers. So, here is my the the   chat interface. I was just chatting   about it. I was just chatting with   OpenClaw about my personal website,   kins.cc.

  So, if I go to the website, it's very   old. I haven't updated this for so long   and so I was thinking about just telling   uh so basically I asked if it could   figure out how to access my website uh   through GitHub because it's hosted on my   GitHub which I already have connected to   GitHub.

 I already have connected to   OpenClaw and so it cloned the repo. It   found the correct repo. It cloned it and   then it just gave me these suggestions.   So, I'm not I'm actually just going to   say make it update the website. So, I'm   just saying update the website in   whatever way you think is best. And so,   since it has access to my GitHub and   this is stored on GitHub pages, it can   actually make live changes to my   website.

 So, it's saying I'll do a full   refresh, modern design, updated content,   everything current. Let me build it out.   I actually have no idea what it's going   to come up with and it's live, but you   know, this website's not super   important. Normally, you're going to   want to verify things before you update   things live, but let's just see what it   comes up with.

 While it's doing that,   I'm going to show you some other things   on OpenClaw. So, there's a few things   you can actually get set up on this. One   of them is the cron jobs, which is very   interesting. Basically, you can tell   Open Claw that you want to do things on   a regular basis, and then it will create   a cron job.

 So, I have a few uh a few   things set up. So, I have it so it will   check different sponsorships for my   personal channel in my hey.com email. I   have it so it's going to work on a a SAS   that I'm building every night. I have it   give me a morning briefing of just   important information   uh every morning for my calendar. I have   it uh basically every week it's going to   write me one YouTube script with slides   to make a YouTube video.

 I have it so it   can uh automatically outreach to   sponsors for my personal channel. And so   it's going to have do these things based   on the cron job. So, one cool thing   about OpenClaw is I have it set to   connect to my email, but it can also do   things that don't have a a direct way to   connect.

 So, I have email through   hey.com and there's not an API or it's   hard to connect spec uh directly, but I   can have it use a web browser, a visual   web browser on the computer. So, I have   it actually access my hey.com email   through just like a regular web browser   and it just uses the the visual cues and   everything to access and do things on my   hey.com email.

 So, that's one thing cool   is it's not just a CLI, it can also do   things on your desktop. So, let me go   back over to my chat and it says done.   if it finished making all these changes   to my personal website. So, let me just   go over to it and refresh and see what   it looks like. Okay, this is   interesting.

 So, it just like completely   made these changes to my personal   website. We even have a new photo on   here and it says what I'm working on, uh   where to find me, some featured videos,   get in touch. It's now giving my uh   hey.com email address and I have a now   page about what I'm working on now. So,   okay, I'm just going to leave it up for   here for here. Um, it looks pretty nice.

  So, that's just kind of interesting how   I could just tell it to make changes to   a live website and it'll just make those   changes. I didn't even know what to   expect. And interesting, it now it added   a link to   nowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowowow.

com   explain what a now page is which is   where I where I got the idea for a now   page. I wonder where that link is. Oh   this is a now page. So this is actually   something created by Derek Civers uh   author and creator that I follow. So you   basically you can tell open claw to do   anything.

 Um, like I said, some I've   asked it to make a tutorial with a   slideshow and a script. So, if I go to   my personal tutorial website, this all   SQL syntax in 14 minutes,   >> SQL syntax in as quickly as possible.   Whether you're just getting started or   need a quick refresher, department, and   projects. These tables have columns like   ID, name, salary, department ID, hire   date, and so on.

 So, this whole   tutorial, it's a 13 or 14-minute   tutorial. It was created with openclaw.   I just it made all these slides and it   made the script and I just read the   script and went through the slides to to   explain SQL syntax in 14 minutes. And so   basically, Open Clock can help you with   whether you're a software developer, a   creator, um, and or whatever you do,   it's going to be able to to help you   with anything that you're doing on a   computer.

 And it also works great with   other tool the other tools we covered   with code rabbit. It can actually   connect with code rabbit. It can connect   with cloud code. It can connect with   copilot. Anything that has a CLI it can   use because it's actually working right   on my local computer. So it can monitor   your PRs and ping you when you code red   rabbit finds issues.

 It can spawn cloud   code sessions and manage them remotely.   It basically is an orchestration layer   for your entire AI workflow. So the open   cloud documentation has so much   information. Basically these are all the   messaging platforms you can connect to   it on. So I currently have it to set up   on WhatsApp and discord and so I can   contact I can send messages openclaw   through discord.

 So, I've connected to   this open claw, uh, this maltbot. It   basically, uh, that's my open claw. And   I I can say I'm going to say, "What is   on my calendar?" And it's only going to   respond to Discord if you messaged it on   Discord. It's only going to respond on   WhatsApp if you messaged it on WhatsApp.   But you can tell it from any platform to   send to any other platform.

 So on   Discord, I could tell it to send   something to my WhatsApp. Okay, now it's   giving me my upcoming calendar. Nice.   It's even wishing me a happy birthday.   The key insight with OpenClaw is that   it's self-improving. You can literally   ask it to build new capabilities for   itself.

 Say you wanted to check your   email every morning. You tell it create   a skill that checks my hey.com inbox   each morning and summarizes important   emails. It builds the integration, tests   it, and starts using it. This is   different from traditional software   where where you have to wait for someone   to add features.

 With OpenClaw, if you   can describe it, it can probably build   it. OpenClaw also works beautifully with   the other tools we've covered. With Code   Rabbit, OpenClaw can monitor your PRs   and ping you when Code Rabbit finds   issues. With Cloud Code, OpenClaw can   spawn cloud code sessions and manage   them remotely.

 And with C-Pilot,   OpenClaw can commit and push code you're   writing in VS Code. It becomes the   orchestration layer for your entire AI   workflow. If you're interested, check   out OpenClaw.ai.   There's an active community building   skills and sharing workflows.   The most productive developers don't   just use one AI tool.

 They combine them   strategically. So here's how you could   use different tools for different   things. So for planning, you could use   cloud code with Ultraink for   architecture decisions. Then you can   implement using C-pilot in VS Code for   rapid coding. You could use code rabbit   to catch issues. You could use Gemini   for its large context window and open   clock can actually kind of combine all   things these things together because   open clock can use any CLI tool.

 So it   can use clog code, it can use code   rabbit, it could use Gemini and   basically each tool has a different   thing that it does best. So the   combination is more powerful than any   single tool. Now let's talk about model   context protocol or MCP. It's basically   a way to give AI tools extra   capabilities.

 So think of MCP servers   like apps for your AI. Without MCP, your   AI is limited to what you tell it. It   can't search for documentation, access   databases, or test websites. But with   MCP, it can access real-time information   and interact with external systems.   Basically, it's a way to give your AI   your um AI different tools that it can   use.

 So, for example, for cloud code,   you can create a config file at just uh   cl.cloudmcp.json   if you're on Mac. And then if you put in   this code or this JSON, it's basically   going to give Cloud the ability Cloud   the ability to browse the web and test   websites for you. So it's giving the the   Puppeteer tool to be able to go through   websites and then Duck.

Go that's   basically uh for for web search. And so   the puppeteers for the browser   automation, you can also give it   different MCP servers that will allow it   to do file operations or connect to   GitHub for repo management or uh   Postgress for database queries. And now   here's another pattern you can use to   kind of combine different AI tools.

 You   can first write tests with cloud code.   Then you can generate test code with   Gemini. You can implement with co-pilot   agent mode saying something like   implement the payment services service   to pass all these tests. Then you can   review with code rabbit which is going   to catch different edge cases you   missed.

 So the tests can guide the AI   implementation and code rabbit quality   checks everything. This is a good   pattern because tests give the AI   concrete goals to code against and then   you have the immediate feedback on   correctness. So let's try combining   everything right now. So first I'll run   claude and then I'll just say ultrathink   plan the architecture for a user   dashboard with analytics.

 So, we'll   start by planning everything with   Claude. And then it's I just have to   confirm that I want to proceed. And it's   realized that the project directory is   currently empty. And then it's just   going to give me some choices of how I   want to of what framework I want to use.   So, I'm going to basically answer some   questions so it knows exactly what I   want. And I'll submit my answers.

 And   now it's able to use uh tools. It can do   a web search. Okay. It's created the   plan and I can actually execute the plan   itself. So I can tell it what I want to   do. I'll just execute the whole plan.   And now it's basically going to just   build the entire project. Took a while,   but it actually build out the entire   dashboard.

 I'll just ask it to commit   this.   Now I'll just ask it to run locally.   Okay, it has the server running locally.   Okay, here it is running and there's a   login. We don't have to look at the   whole thing right now. And now I can   open up VS Code and basically look   through the code. And I'm just going to   tell it to look through the code and   suggest improvements.

 And it's going to   implement secure visitor ID and some   other improvements here. Now I'm just   going to ask it to open a PR with the   change. So there we go. Okay. Now I'm   going to tell it to run code rabbit   prompt only and fix any issues it finds.   So basically this is how we can use one   AI tool inside another AI tool and then   I just have to allow the command.

 Okay,   in this case it looks like the review   from Code Rabbit had no actionable   issues reported. I guess that's good.   But now you can see how this would work.   Uh if you did have it's always good to   to run a review just to see if there is   issues and then it can fix it right   within the within the AI tool.

 Okay,   let's talk a little bit about AI code   quality. So AI generate code needs human   oversight. And so here's a good quality   checklist. You want to make sure it   actually runs, that the the logic makes   sense, that the functions and variables   are defined and just see if it feels   wrong and definitely test edge cases.

  And there's a lot of things you need to   look out for. Sometimes AI will make up   functions, the wrong parameters and   such. There could be missing air   handling. Honestly, right now, AI can   often solve some of these mistakes   itself because a lot of AI tools will   check its own code after writing it and   then make the the make the fixes.

 But   it's still good to check things   yourself. And what's really important is   checking for security. There's so many   stories out there of people that vibe   code an app and it has horrible   security. So you never want to accept AI   code that has hard-coded passwords or   APIs, eval with user input, uh SQL   without parameterized query sensitive   data and error message and disabled   security features.

 And you're always   going to want to verify that input   verification is present that there's   proper authentication authoriz and   authorization that secrets use   environment variables. This is very   important. A lot of people have   vibecoded uh secrets onto GitHub where   anybody can use it. Uh we want to make   sure the dependencies are up to date and   errors don't expose internals.

 Now these   are security essentials for whether   you're using AI tools or not. But you   definitely want to check when you're   using AI for coding. AI doesn't   understand your security context. Only   you do. So let me show you a concrete   example. AI might create code like this   here, which is basically a function that   builds a SQL query using string   concatenation.

  That's a classic SQL injection   vulnerability. So, here's the safe   version. It uses parameterized queries   instead. And this is exactly the kind of   thing that Code Rabbit catches   automatically in code reviews. So,   that's uh Code Rabbit is especially   helpful when you're using AI to write   code.

 So, let's just talk a little bit   about how to write a good prompt because   better prompts equals better results.   So, basically   use this formula where you're giving a   lot more information. Don't don't just   uh to try to be as specific as possible.   Basically, you want to be specific about   input parameters and types, expected   output format, error handling   requirements, style preferences, and   that's going to make your your resulting   code better.

 So, here's just a final   quick reference for what tool to reach   for like get uh based on the tools that   we've covered in this tutorial. GitHub   Copilot is great for real-time coding in   VS Code, quick completions, learning new   APIs. Then code rabbit for PR reviews   and qu and quality gates security   analysis team consistency.

 Then we have   cloud code and gemini are great for uh   complex refactoring architectural   discussions autonomous dev sessions and   then open claw for background automation   multi-tool orchestration and proactive   assistance. And like I said earlier co   open claw can help tie everything else   together.

 So we've covered a lot in this   course. So let's recap what we've   learned. AI speeds up implementation,   but you make the decisions. Also, uh you   should always use the right tool for the   job. Always verify AI generated code.   Security is your responsibility. And   better prompts equals better results. So   here are just some tools and resources   from today's course.

 You can also check   the description for links. And thanks   for watching. Leave a comment and let us   know what AI tools you're excited to   try. Happy coding.   And I want to demo ones I think are most   useful. Code rabbit plan, premerge   checks, and some advanced CLI workflows.   First up is Code Rabbit plan. The idea   is simple.

 Before you write any code,   you create a plan. You describe what you   want in a GitHub issue and Code Rabbit   analyzes your code base and generates a   detailed coding plan. Let me show you   how it works.

Amir is back on the pod. Thank you. Uh   by the end of this episode, what are   people going to learn? Today we're going   to cover three aspects of building   business, using new tools to actually   build out landing pages, and then using   other tools like humble to actually   create high converting landing pages and   running experiments.

 So, we're going to   cover how to actually use idea browser   to build the right amount of context and   planning to come up with an idea and   build a landing page behind it, validate   it, refine a design using paper design,   and then going into humbulics and then   running an experiment and tracking data   to then come back and keep optimizing   for conversions.

  >> And you're going to commit to giving all   the sauce. You're not holding back.   >> Raw. We're going to go going to go   through everything, all the sauce. By   the end of this, you're going to learn   what it takes to take an idea, validate   it, refine it, build a landing page with   a nice design that's not vibe coded, and   then get the right data to make some   money.

  >> Okay? Cuz there's a lot of tutorials   that sort of promise that, right? But   then you end up with like a purple vibe   coded landing page.   >> Do I ever let you down?   >> No, you don't.   >> I don't let you down. That's true. There   you go.   >> All right. Let's let's go. Let's get   into it.   >> All right.

 So,   Idea browser came out with something   really cool um I really like which is   basically you can now directly connect   idea browser to cloud code as an MCP.   What's really interesting about it is   you know you guys used to focus a lot on   finding the right idea and then building   it.

 But what was missing was how do you   track the natural progression of how the   business is evolving over time with the   right context and documents to then come   back and reference and say, "Okay, cool.   Like this is the idea I had. Here's how   I started with ICP positioning. Now I   want to come back and refine this or   help me figure out um kind of what to   pitch for or who to go after as my   customers.

" So I was playing around with   Jordan earlier today. We were on a live   stream and we found this really cool   idea which was an AI sparring partner   for B2B sales teams. The idea was how do   we build a tool that kind of essentially   helps reps practice on prospects on real   time and get them to essentially go   through simulations of being like, you   know, going through a sales call and   getting feedback on what they can   improve on.

 We put together a quick   landing page. We made some designs and   then got some data in there and started   tracking it. So, for today's episode,   we're going to build on top of this.   We're going to refine the messaging.   We're going to go through some sections   on the website, refine the copy and   design, show you how to use paper for   that, and then also uh yeah, get some   experiments and AB testing in there.

  >> Cool.   >> Um so what I so what we have so far is   we have this one specific file which is   uh like um offer definition and talk   tracks that tells you who your your   target customer is, the transformation,   the offer, the value, competitive   positioning. What's really cool is you   guys also have skills in here which you   can use to then build on top of the   idea.

 Um, so I actually want to use the   lead magnet legend here, this specific   skill to build the specific lead landing   page site um to kind of get someone to   come sign up and you know go through   this process. So we're going to open up   terminal and we already have all the   MCPS connected. So if I go to MCP you   can see I have idea browser, I have   paper, all that.

 We're going to go   through it. So, I'm going to say connect   to idea   idea browser MCP. Um, look at my AI B2B   sparring partner project. Pull the right   context. Then use the lead magnet skill   to create a   By the way, I just got to say this cuz   people are going to hate on you for the   comments.

 In the comments, you type your   your prompts. You don't use voice.   Listen, I love Whisper Flow, but tell me   how I'm going to do this while I'm doing   the pod. Okay. All right. Just just you   got to bear with me here.   >> Okay. So, when you're at home, are you   using Whisper Flow or are you still   typing?   >> I am.

 So, I'm using I usually use   Whisper Flow when I'm initially starting   a project or some some session and it's   like a long It depends on honestly on   the context of how much information I'm   going to put in the terminal. But yeah,   no, I got Whisper Flow, you know. Okay.   I'm I'm up to date with the tools.   So what we're doing right now is we've   pulled the right project context and so   like we have context right here that's   built as a file and then um we're then   we also have a growth strategy that we   worked on earlier and then from there   we're going to uh build out a lead   magnet specifically for this idea. So we   have this AI B2B sparring partner. Um   what's really cool is you got have you   guys have this like activity streak to   keep building on kind of your business.   And that's like the biggest problem   these days. Like everyone can build   landing pages. Everyone has ideas. How   do you actually like know where to get   customers? How do you actually grow it?   And that's the next kind of gap that   we're all trying to solve for right now.   >> Well, yeah. I think uh we've all tried   the vibe coding tools. We've all built   stuff.

  >> Um I do think that having the right idea   is important.   >> Um finding the right niche is important.   >> But you know, the other thing is just   like how do you get customers?   uh to to honestly just give you   confidence to keep going.   >> Exactly.   >> Yeah.   >> Yeah. Yeah. And and we're gonna   eventually get there and I think you   guys do a really good job of this and   I'm not like promoting like I'm   promoting idea browser don't get me   wrong but I wasn't you know I'm actually   using this tool myself now because that   was kind of the biggest gap I had myself   like with Humbolty was like okay cool I   have all these great ideas and I've been   understanding who our customer is and   trying to get customers through trial   and error. And I was telling Jordan   Jordan earlier I was like I wish I had   idea bowseres sooner right so that I can   come back and use these specific skills   to um to understand okay cool what is   the right growth strategy because a lot   of what you guys have has been fully   refined and we were going through this   earlier today and it was interviewing me   and asking me questions and I was like   this is so impressive I wish I had   humbalytics for this specifically so   that I can come back and say okay cool

  like humb to go after director of   marketings in this specific field with   this kind of messaging and yeah so kudos   to you guys for building a really cool   product with this and I think a lot of   people now can actually use this to   build the idea and then also help build   the business as well.

 Um so we going   back to cloud code we were connected to   MCP we have built out the lead magnet   which is basically five objections that   kill fright software deals. So we   actually niched down we built this AI   BDB sparring partner in the fright   software industry and it's going to say   you're going to want to create a PDF   guide um give them all Yep.

 So this is   great. Okay, cool. So we we have the   idea of the lead magnet and it should   now actually save   the file in here. Let's go back. Boom.   Now we have the file. So this is really   cool. Like you have context of the ideas   it came with and it's added here. Um now   we're going to come back and use the the   scale. I got to come back here.

 We have   the where is this? The landing page   architect. using and basically what   we're going to do now is for the people   that don't know paper is it's a really   cool tool where essentially it's   connected so I'm going to take a step   back typically with Figma you had   designers creating static assets in   Figma landing page designs and then   handing off to engineering teams right   the missing gap was now we have a lot of   people that are building landing pages   and websites with cloud code directly in   code and refining it through there and   then losing track of like what they're   iterating on and not having the ability   to be able to kind of refine this. So   with paper, what you're able to do is   actually um have an interface connected   to cloud code where you're ideulating   creating iterations of iterations   directly in the design and then coming   up with like what direction you want to   go with and then having it in code. So   it's kind of like the intermediary step   that we were missing before where people   are just directly building in code

  >> and you know you can use paper. Or are   there any other competitors that people   use or just or just stick to paper?   >> I mean, so Figma just recently came out   with their birectional ACP. MC ACP.   >> I'm in your world, man.   >> Totally.   >> Yeah. MCP. Um uh where you can both   design like uh you can take a design and   build it to code or code to design to go   birectional, which this is essentially   what paper already is.

 Um, but I just   feel like um, the tooling and the   interface and the experience on paper is   a lot nicer in my opinion and it just   works a lot better. So, we're we're now   connected to we've we've captured the   lead magnet. We have the landing page   scale architect being added as well with   the offer that we want to have and now   we want to actually build out the page   using paper.

 So, while that's going   through it, I want to talk about kind of   how you can refine your designs as well.   So often times you see people with kind   of these vibecoded designs and they're   not entirely sure how to actually go   with like the right direction of   building out a design system. What I   typically like to do is always give   Claude um a reference image of an   existing design that I like.

 So, for   example, I'll go into um an existing   site or have some bookmarks of sites I   like and I'll take the screenshots and   I'll drop it into cloud and I'll say   extrapolate like the key design elements   from these pages and help me create a   design system. So, what you're seeing   right now for example is a design system   that I've created using cloud based on   reference images so that we can kind of   reference back into for future sessions.

  So if I want to come back and create a   new section or new component my landing   page, I can say reference design style   guide as like the basis as you're   creating new components so that you have   that consistency. Um now I want to show   an example like again a lot of people   have this misconception that vibe coded   design is bad.

 This has all been fully   vivecoded. We built all these   animations, all these components using   claude and doesn't seem that way. It   seems very polished, very well refined.   And the way to do that is you refine it   through paper and then give example   components and illustrations from other   websites or libraries to build on top   of.

 So for example, um I use this tool   quite a lot. It's called Tail Arc Tail   Pro and they have a lot of great   existing blocks and illustrations that   you can use and you can actually install   these and use it as a reference. So I'll   go back into paper and I'll show you   kind of how Oh, nice. Right now, we're   seeing Cloud Code design and build   directly in paper on what this lead   magnet looks like, which is   >> really cool.

  >> Really, really cool. I love the little   kind of section by section it's building   out.   So, I think this is perfect. Actually,   this is a great segue to that. So, we're   going to let it build out the landing   page. Then, I'm going to show you how   you can actually use tail arc as a   reference point to then improve the   design of this.

 So, so it goes from   something like this to something a   little bit more tailored like like this   for example.   >> By the way, there's an ant on the table   just there. Do we do we let the ant   watch your your your demonstration or do   we you know or do we sort of move him   aside? What do you think?   >> I think we'll just we'll give him put   him put him in I mean where do we put   him?   >> Um I mean I I have nothing against the   Yeah, he's chilling.

  >> He's chilling.   >> He's getting the direct sauce. Yeah,   he's we can give the ant some sauce, you   know.   >> Here's a napkin in case.   >> Yeah.   >> Um, okay, cool. So, we're building out   the section, which is pretty cool. Now,   like a lot of people say, "Okay, cool.   Like, why don't I just build this   directly in code? Why do I have to   actually use paper?" The idea is that   you can use paper to help build out   different variations.

 So, if I want to   try different layouts, I can just do it   directly in here, make some refinements   myself, especially for designers. I   think this is super powerful for   designers that want to just jump in and   start changing things themselves without   having to kind of use cloud code again   or existing components they have.

 So   we'll let this finish then I want to   show you some examples of what I've also   created in paper to show you that what's   what's possible if you keep refining it   and go through it go through it.   Perfect. So we're all done here. Now   what does this look like in actual real   practice if you spend time refining   this. So this is all designed in paper.

  Um, I've given the design style guide I   have in Humbolytics. I've said here's   the components you have and use these   components to refine it. So, I actually   build out some of these sections in here   and then port it over to code. I or I   even use it to create static assets that   I want to use in ads, in thumbnails,   whatever it is.

 This is all purely you   like built using cloud. Now, how do you   go back to actually refine the design   here? Um, so what I do typically is I'll   go into Tail Arc and find a section that   I like. So we have this like content   area section. I'll go into   um let's go into content   right here. Okay, cool. I like I like   this. I like this right here.

 Or maybe   yeah, we'll use this one. Cool. So I'll   go back in the terminal and I'll say   install this tail arc component and use   it for the content section in the lead   magnet first. Design it in paper and   then we just need to pull the API key   for tail arc. Cool.   >> I've actually never heard of tail arc.   >> Really?   >> Yeah.

  >> Yeah. It's it's just another UI library.   I mean   >> I'm not sure who's behind it. I think   it's like an indie founder or something   like that.   >> Looks clean.   >> Yeah. Super clean. It's the way to go,   you know. Kudos or shout out to whoever   built this. I think it's a indie person.   So, whoever it is, you've done a great   job. Keep keep doing it.

  >> Um, yeah, I'm a fan. I'm I'm a big fan.   They got taste, that's for sure.   So, what we're doing right now, we're   just installing Tail Arc so that we can   like install the right components here.   And   um, yeah, what's special about this is   that you can take those components that   I showed you earlier.

 So if we're going   to, for example, we're going to do the   content one,   this one specifically, and I can just   drop it in as well, a screenshot to say   like install this, use this component,   and then I'll go back into paper and say   like use it for this section here.   What's also interesting uh is, you know,   showing tail arc, showing idea browser,   the MCP, it's sort of a glimpse into   like the future of software, right? Like   you're not in the past we would go and   just use SAS, right? Yeah,   >> now it's like the work is getting done   in the terminal.   >> Nailed it to again. It's becoming the   interface for work for everything. You   know, if you remember our first episode   cursor was Yeah. Like   >> you were you were right.   >> So you said   >> what? I think your exact words were   something like   >> like Yeah. B I I think the mistake I   made was I I I said cursor. That's what   you said.   >> Yeah. Cursor is the interface of work or   it's the future of interface of work. I   would say now terminal. The terminal is   interface of work. We were, you know, we

  were very, you know, we were early. We   were early. We were early. Like we're   like, "Yo, markdowns are going to become   a thing. You're going to do all your   work in cursor, all of it in terminal."   >> People thought we were crazy.   >> Yeah. Yeah. Like   >> here we are today, man. Everyone, you   know,   >> and we're showing you this and someone   probably listening to this is probably   like, "You guys are crazy.

"   >> 100%. Yeah, you know, uh, another thing   for example was like you're now seeing   people building out markdown pages on   their websites to make it easier for   agents to access, right? You look at   what's happening now. People are giving   agents wallets. What's going on here?   They're giving out wallets.

 They're   giving them um emails, inboxes, stuff   like that. So, it's insane to see um   Yeah, yeah, it's it's insane to see kind   of the evolution of that. And we're   seeing actually tangent um   I have a thesis. The thesis is that more   agents are going to actually visit uh   websites than humans.   >> Mhm.

 I mean that's that's I'm 100%   certain of that. It's not even you know   >> I saw that Gartner had a research report   that said 20% of commerce will on the   internet by 2030 will be agents. meaning   like agents are buying things.   >> Um, you know that the the   tail or what's the the how do I say   this? Basically where it's all where   it's going is agents doing more and more   things.

 So obviously yeah there's just   there's going to be way more agents than   humans. Therefore there's going to be   way more consumption of agents of   products.   >> Yeah. And it's like the multiplier   effect too, right? Because you have   people running multiple open claws or   multiple agents. Exactly.   >> On behalf of one person   >> and who was it? There was a report   saying I don't know if they were serious   but they're saying yeah we should put a   tax on a we should put a tax on agents   right because it's like   yeah it's making us more productive   there's a whole think about human beings   right like if you have a if you   >> if you're running a company and you want   to hire someone you have to pay payroll   tax on that person right   >> so of course then you know governments   are going to be like well   >> it's kind of like you're hiring a person   Therefore, there should be some taxes   that, you know, agents have to pay.   >> There there's an arbitrage opportunity   right there, right? Like you you as a   single human now have an army of agents   working for you on your behalf. They're   a multiplier effect of what your income

  is or whatever it is that you're doing   more productive.   Yeah. Where's like, you know, you're   making more money. Yeah. I wouldn't be   surprised at some point we have some   agent tax. It's like on on your taxes   like list out the agents you have. But   um but anyways, uh back to kind of   talking about the future of web. Yeah.

  Like we're also seeing right now um   more websites being built to be agent   friendly, right? Firecraw fire uh cloud   for came out with their um endpoint to   be able to crawl websites to give access   to agents to be able to get the data   they need. And you know we actually had   our website built in web flow.

 Then we   migrated to framework and now we fully   built in custom code. Why? Because we   wanted to be able to use the agent as   our CMS. So use cloud code to directly   update our CMS and the act ability to   give access to other tools to like   quickly ship changes, run tests, give   access to our agents and MCPS which is   you can now kind of do with web phone   framework but it's not as open as you   want it to be essentially.

  >> So   >> makes sense.   >> Yeah, that's kind of the the the thought   process behind it. Let's go back. Okay,   nice. So yeah, we're getting a much   nicer refined design here. Um, and then   if we wanted to, we can go back and like   maybe find more components to drop. So,   um, let's look at like maybe   So, one of the things I really liked   about your website, the Humble Litics   website, is like the animations were   really good.

  >> Yeah.   >> How do you think about like if we wanted   to like update the designs here to be a   little more animated, how would we do   that?   >> Yeah. So, I So, right now we're doing   right now. So, I basically went into   here. Um, so this one has a very subtle   animation. I copied this component and I   dropped it back into terminal in cloud   code.

 I said, "Hey, add the section and   then add a subtle animation." And the   goal like I always say like you don't   want to overanimate things. It's   interesting to see how like agents   respond to constraints and guard rails,   especially around like, hey, make subtle   changes, subtle animation, subtle design   refinements. I'm actually very   intentional with that word when I use it   with agents because like if you say   improve the design, it's so broad and   generic.

 Whereas you say, "Hey, work on   refining the design. Make sure you have   consistent layouts and themes and keep   it subtle enough to make sure there's   like cohesiveness across the entire   page." I find that prompt works a lot   better than just saying improve the   design.   >> Keep it subtle, stupid.   >> Yeah, keep it subtle. Exactly. Exactly.

  There you go. Um, so you know, while   that's happening, I'll say when you're   done, make the changes in the code and   push it and tell me the URL for it and   add a section on the homepage to the   lead magnet. Cool. We already have the   site right now and um,   we're going to now add that lead magnet   section.

 So, we were actually earlier   today with Jordan and I in the live   stream, we're building out the home   section, the hero section, and we   started working on the steps below it.   But now what we're going to do is build   a lead magnet page using what we just   covered in paper and the designs. Um,   and then yeah, we're going to push it   live to the website and then run some   get some analytics in there and run some   experiments to see what drives more   conversions.

  >> Cool.   >> Cool.   >> Yeah. And then like for the audience,   like keep in mind like we're doing this   really really quickly. We're speed   running through this,   >> you know. Um, obviously like if you look   at this design, it's a lot more refined   than what it would be. Typically, I   would spend a couple hours going through   this, going through specifically like   different illustrations or blocks or   sections.

 I just want to cover like the   key principles of how I approach it and   then you can come back and like use   these different components to refine   each individual section. Any questions,   thoughts? Yeah, I think uh I was just   just thinking about this like we we all   have these this you know expectations   that you're going to like one prompt   something, two prompt something, three   prompt.

 So I'm happy you said that it's   probably going to take a couple hours   >> if you really do want to get it dialed.   So I I just I don't want people to go   through this whole process and be like   >> well when air did it look so so much   better. Well, air amir first of all you   had the library so that was helping but   also you know it takes time right   >> it takes a lot of time like we yeah we I   mean it doesn't take a lot of time if   you think about it just takes like   >> imag you know if air from 2017 saw this   >> oh like   and heard that and heard that you said   it took a lot of time   >> you'd be like what is air on   >> no yeah no   >> but it takes time it takes some amount   of   It takes time, taste, and skill to know   what you got to do and how to do it,   right? It's like we've we made it so   easy to achieve the tasks. How do you   give the agents the right direction and   approach to say here's how you need to   do it?   >> The taste taste is what we know we've   been talking about a lot.

  >> Yeah.   >> And and direction, right? Like this   particular component needs subtle   animation. Here's a reference of that.   >> Exactly. Exactly. Like I built this   component from scratch. not from   scratch. Off an existing component that   was I think let's actually find it.   >> So you found a component here.

  >> Exactly. So I found a component here.   We're going to find it cuz I know I'll   tell you where it is. So like this is   for example right here. Okay. So we had   this component   >> and   this is it right here. I I ported this   one over but I said add a sol animation   to switch through it for example or or   this analytics query right here.

 So this   one is   this one   >> right now that specific component I   think it was it was one of these one of   these cards essentially and yeah I took   it and I said hey based on this   component oh right here this one it was   this one and I turned it into   >> this   which is you know   >> I think it looks great.   >> Yeah.   >> Yeah.

  >> Yeah. So cool. So, we we've we've built   out the design of the guide page in   here. Um, and now we're going to see if   it's live on the website. So, let's push   this and then we're going to go to   guide.   Boom. So, now we have it. We have the   sections here. Okay. So, now let's get   some analytics in here to see how many   people actually could sign up for this   lead magnet.

  >> So, I just want to say one thing. This   lead magnet looks gorgeous. Like, think   about this lead magnet. looks better   than 99.99999%   of lead magnets that exist. Right? So   people listening to this like this is   uh think think about you know don't just   create one lead magnet, right? Like   every few weeks create new lead magnets,   optimize your lead magnets and you're   going to be able to outperform because   you're going to know how to do and   create gorgeous looking lead magnets.

  >> Exactly. And we did we did this in like   30 minutes. Again, like you get the   right components, the right direction.   You can do some research on the best   ones, port them over as reference   styles, and then make that refinement.   So, right now, while you were going   through it, I found this kind of decent   component.

 I was like, why don't we just   try this design instead and add it? So,   let's see what happens.   >> Yeah.   >> Okay, cool. It's going to adopt it and   it's going to have that split split   layout. All right, so we've got this   lead magnet. We'll wait while it's   refining the design. We're going to come   back and essentially get some analytics   installed and look at some click   tracking form submissions and run some   experiments to see if I were to change   this headline headline for example um   what would this look like and you know   what would increase more form   submissions for our leads and we we use   this approach at uh humble we just   started actually where we built like an   autonomous CRO agent where we have   direct skills and MCPs connected to a   cloud so we directly connect to our   track our analytics and experimentation   tool, our marketing site, which is why   we ported over to custom code. We   wouldn't have been able to do this   through Webflow and then we have Google   Ads. The idea is how can we spin up   multiple subpages that are personalized   campaigns like personalized campaign   landing pages based on the campaigns we

  have. So, like if I'm running a a a   painoint campaign on Google Ads and I   have five adsets, I want each one to   have its own personalized landing page   and I want to AB test each individual   landing page to see what headline   resonates the most or what layout for   example.

 Um, you're able to do this with   the custom code site really quickly with   cloud code. With framer or web flow, you   have to create the pages, create the   sections, come back and update it. You   know what I mean? So that's kind of the   whole thesis we're talking about earlier   where it's like the feature of websites   is custom code and the agent is the CMS   and then you have it running and you can   even set up like um uh so what we do is   we have like a cron job now directly in   cloud code because they support   automated tasks to say every week go   into um like run this specific task. So   what we have is Google ads directly   connect to cloud through the API. We   have three cloud scales a paid media   manager that pulls data from meta and   Google. We have a CRO optimizer that   runs AB tests and then we have a funnel   report that just gives us a report of   like here's how many users you had   signed up. It connects to stripe chart   mobile all the different tools that we   have and then we have humbalytics that   essentially hits our endpoint to give   you recommendations actually uses fire   crawl to scrape the pages and then um uh   helps you kind of say okay here's what   you need to optimize for helps you run

  the experiment all through cloud and   then it manages the manages the like the   results for you. I mean   that is just so cool that we live in a   world where you can do that.   >> I know. Yeah. Yeah. And the best part is   you can actually use this with idea   browser to pull all that context and   save it as a file back into idea   browser.

  >> Jordan and I were talking about this   like yo we can do this now. Like imagine   you do a weekly report. You pull all the   data you add it into idea browser and   now Idea browser has contest of like how   growth has been over time   >> which is   which is sort of the unlock right.   >> Yeah. Yeah.   You know, if you have that, you're just   going to get better results.

 You're   going to compound and that's like how   you can compete in Right.   >> Yeah. Exactly. Um, so we just added the   the component to the like we installed   this new component, but I realized the   mistake we made was we got rid of the   form, so we're adding it back in. But   yeah, like the to your point, uh, we   actually before this, we were tracking   all the context directly in Obsidian as   well.

 So we have a master like   performance log.   >> Yeah.   >> It says like here's how this AB tested.   Here's how much money it made. Here's   what you need to improve on. And we just   come back to this context. So we have   this all set up now. We have this   landing page. And let's go back to the   homepage and maybe run an an experiment   on this homepage to see if we can   increase clickthrough rates.

 So what   I'll do is I'll spin up cloud again. And   then we're going to go into so with   Humbolytics you can just go directly to   the API create an API key get your   property details and instructions to hit   the cloud. Uh but what it you know you   get the basic analytics you would   typically see where people are visiting   from traffic you know the channels   everything you want if you're looking to   like run paid ad campaigns you get full   attribution directly in here so you can   see exactly what channels are making you   money. You can have heat maps to see   scroll depth, what people are clicking   on, the full experience. You can even   create funnels. So, for example, if you   want to go like, you know, from page to   guide, you can even run it. It'll show   you what people went through his steps.   Um, and then you can run AB experiments.   So, we have zero right now. We're going   to use Claude to actually run an   experiment. So, we're just going to copy   this. just gonna   and then we're going to have a we have a   dedicated skill for this but I thought

  just to show people the steps. So using   this approach   create an AB experiment no code type for   the headline   suggest what the headline   >> so you have a skill for this?   >> We do.   >> Yeah.   >> Yeah. I I'll share the link afterwards   that people can use where essentially   we'll help you get set up with like   comolytics, run experiments, get   recommendations.

 But we have endpoints   right now that you can hit to say okay   like tell your agent or cloud code hit   the specific endpoint the   recommendations endpoint and it'll   actually scrape your site pull traffic   insights pull all the existing data you   have in homalytics and even idea browser   and then give you a very detailed report   on here's what you should like focus on   for your landing page or what you should   test.

  >> Yeah.   >> Nice. So it's pulling insights based on   analytics. We have a 40% average scroll   25% bounce rate. Here's the page   content. Here's what your control should   be and then here's what you should be   what should be the variant. Okay, cool.   We should now go back into experiments.   We now have an AB test running directly   through here, which is crazy.

 It's   actually insane. And we did this without   even deploying change cuz our script   dynamically updates the content on the   site without you having to go to your   developers and say, "Hey, like can you   can you create this new page or push it   for us?" So, this is what we had. If I   refresh this   maybe a couple times because it's like   it's distributing traffic. Let's see.

  >> Right.   >> There we go.   >> Every lost deal started with an   objection your rep wasn't ready for.   Honestly, not bad.   >> Pretty fire.   >> Yeah. But here's the cool thing. We just   launched an experiment.   >> Yeah.   >> And it automatically updated the page   without pushing code. And now you're   tracking to see how this headline will   actually impact conversions. Yeah.

 So if   I click this for example, you know, and   then let's say we go back to control. So   this is right now showing. Okay, now   we're on control and we go back in here.   We can see exactly   >> how conversion is doing.   >> So it's still pretty early. So it's   going to like not have any good data to   show, but it's showing you even what   people are clicking on directly and   telling you how the test is doing.

  >> Insane.   >> Yeah.   >> Insane.   >> It's also insane that like I don't know   anyone who's doing this.   Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah. We we I think   this this stack right here um what I   showed between going from idea to   refining in paper then analyzing   optimizing for this like if you're a go   to market person or marketing person and   use a stack you're unstoppable. Yeah.

 So   we're we're we're doing this at scale   now. We're running a bunch of paid meta   ads Google ads directly connected   pulling all the context creating   personalized pages and seeing like   what's what's making money. I mean   there's also an opportunity to actually   take this stack and sell this as a   service right like how many businesses   you know would would pay 5 10 15 20   grand a month   >> if you can actually be doing this   >> for them like probably a lot.

 Yeah, we   so we actually have a couple customers   that work with us and say, "Hey, like   we'll pay you like 5k, 10k a month. Can   you just run   >> right?   >> Can you just use your software and then   run it for us?" Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.   Because like you can connect meta ads   directly in here, Google ads, get full   revenue attribution and then they say,   "Hey, like just tell us like where where   our top funnel spend should be.

" And so   it's almost like we're seeing this now   too like managed service.   >> Yeah, makes sense.   >> Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, we've I feel like   we've covered a lot, right? We went from   an idea that we had in idea browser to   um to like now having relevant context.   So we can even come back and say like in   the terminal say you know using idea   browser MCP add this info uh to the   context.

 So we can come back and   actually add this as a file right. Um so   we went from idea to designing something   in paper to building a new landing page   to then having analytics and experiments   behind it.   >> Crazy.   What a time to be alive, my friend.   >> What a time to be alive. All right. Was   that Was that saucy?   >> That was saucy, man.

 I like I would be   real with you. Like if this   >> I've I've never seen   anyone do this this fast with this   stack.   >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If it it sometimes I   yearn to be an employee again and like   go to micro marketing so I can just take   this and just blow people's mind away   because it's like   >> it's so much fun.

 Like I wish we had a   million dollar monthly spend so I can   just dabble with these tools   >> and just show them what's possible.   >> Yeah. What's going through my mind is   like there's a lot of arbitrage.   >> Insane,   >> right? Like if you   >> if you can, you know, if you get have   good ideas, if you get, you know, source   of good ideas and you can AB test them   and you can be creating beautiful   websites, you know, lead magnets, that   sort of thing.

 and you have access to 7   billion people who have, you know,   internet connections and and their   credit cards attached to it. Like   there's arbitrage and I remember   >> I remember when the Facebook ad platform   first came out.   >> Oh yeah.   >> And you know the average click I think   back then was 5 cents a click.   >> So meaning like you can create an ad and   I was at the time working with these   social gaming companies.

 So, I would say   like, "Hey, you know, as an example,   Farm Bill, I would say like, would you   pay me $2 for every install I got for   you?" And they'd be like, "Sure. This,   you know, we monetize so much better   than that." And I was just using   Facebook ads cuz I was paying 5 cents a   click. And there was this moment of   opportunity basically where you could do   really well   >> um because of this ad platform and and   and how cheap it is.

 Now, fast forward   to today, I don't even know what a CPC   is. On average, it's probably $2 or   something like that. Yeah, it's $23.   >> $23, right? So, it's it's, you know, so   much more expensive and it's   >> and it's just because people didn't know   back then, right? And it's sort of the   same thing with this with this sort of   stuff. It's like, you know, 99.

999% of   people don't know that this stack   exists.   >> Yeah.   >> And there's an opportunity to create   offers and arbitrage right now.   >> The right tooling, the right approach.   You have a terminal with a million   context tokens. There's the   opportunities are endless.   >> Yeah. you know,   >> so I appreciate you sharing.

  >> Yeah.   >> Um and uh I'll include the link that for   that skill in the show notes in the   description   >> for sure.   >> I'll include links on where to follow   Amir uh on X and and other places.   >> And uh stay saucy, my friend.   >> Thank you for having me, man. Good to   see you.   >> Good to see you. All right.
